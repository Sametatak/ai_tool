Our drive for innovation helped us turn laundry day to laundry done.
Love it! The preloading of detergent is the greatest & the wifi as well for updates on my phone.
Bought this for a new (first) home and we love it so far. Looks good and works well.
The sleek modern look compliments my laundry room. It is so quiet that I had to check several times to make sure it was on.
I never thought I would be as excited as I am about a new washing machine. The soft close lid is such a bonus, especially when the kids are doing there laundry. No more slamming the lid down.
Love, love, love! I love the color. Love the size of the drum, and the speed at which it washes clothes. I got the impeller version. Couldn't be happier.
The jet stream is something I never thought I needed and now cannot live without. My clothes seem cleaner and I am doing less laundry as this machine hold so many clothes!
This machine is what our family needed. Lots of options and lots of loads to wash in the big drum.
For a front loader, it can hold extra large loads and has the perfect wash cycles to get your clothes clean from wash to rinse!
The small top loader is especially useful for washing whites which I generally don't have enough off to need the bottom loader for. The washer is very quiet and energy efficient.
See how others are using their washers and dryers to give their home a design boost in the laundry department.
“With our new Extra-Large Capacity Smart Dial Front Load Washer with OptiWash™ in Brushed Black I can get more laundry done in fewer loads. The super speed setting finishes a load in under 30 minutes!”
“We’ve been appreciating the convenience with every wash, thanks to the AI powered smart dial, WI-FI connectivity, + most of all, quick wash cycles if it’s something you’ve gotta do, for a family of five (soon to be six) may as well make it convenient + beautiful to have in your space!”

Keep clothes smelling fresh, sparkling and stain-free with the best washing machine from Sears. Pick the perfect one for your household from a plethora of options based on your lifestyle, space and budget.
We know that having a reliable washing machine is important for everyone not just busy families with little time on their hands. Make laundry day an easy-breezy event by choosing the right laundry machine that satisfy all your laundry needs. There are diverse options to consider when opting for the best washing machine. So picking the right one becomes very essential keeping certain factors in mind including, energy efficiency, load capacity, portability, top or front load, smart connectivity and more.  Sears has many popular brands like GE, Samsung, LG, Maytag, Whirlpool etc. that serves your need to get your laundry done conveniently and efficiently.
Depending on your laundry habits, you can choose to use front-load washers that offer better efficiency and cleaning results, or top-load washers that render comfort and convenience along with faster wash cycles. If you prefer washers that provide more heavy-duty and thorough clean, opt for top-loading washers with agitator, and if you're looking for an environmentally friendly option without sacrificing performance, front-loading washers must be your pick.
Ease up your laundry load with a new washer and dryer. Sears offers a variety of laundry machine combinations to suit your demands. The amount of room you have at home will determine whether you purchase washer and dryer bundles or washers and dryers individually. While the washer and dryer bundle will maximize space utilization, a set of independent devices requires a little bit more room but offers a greater capacity for drying and is quicker and more energy-efficient.
Portability is another important factor to be considered. A portable washing machine is flexible enough to be used in different locations and can be stored away in a cupboard when not in use, thus offering you a space saving solution.
Schedule and track wash cycles right from your phone and get alerted when clothes are done. Thanks to Wi-Fi-compatible washer models like the LG DLGX4001B 7.4 cu.ft. smart Wi-Fi enabled front-load washing machine, Samsung WF50A8800AV/US 5.0 cu.ft. smart dial front load washer etc.  you can now connect the machine to your smartphone or computer allowing you to monitor and control its performance from anywhere. So wait no longer. Browse through a range of washer and dryers at Sears and find the perfect match for your home.
