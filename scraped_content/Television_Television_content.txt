Television was an American rock band from New York City, most notably active in the 1970s. The group's most prominent lineup consisted of Tom Verlaine (vocals, guitar), Richard Lloyd (guitar), Billy Ficca (drums), and Fred Smith (bass). An early fixture of CBGB and the 1970s New York rock scene, the band is considered influential in the development of punk and alternative rock.[6][7][8]

Although they recorded in a stripped-down, guitar-based manner similar to their punk contemporaries, Television's music was by comparison clean, improvisational, and technically proficient, drawing influence from jazz and 1960s rock.[6][9] The group's 1977 debut album, Marquee Moon, is considered one of the defining releases of the punk era.

Television's roots can be traced to the teenage friendship between Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. The duo met at Sanford School in Hockessin, Delaware, from which they ran away.[10] Both moved to New York, separately, in the early 1970s, aspiring to be poets.[11]

Their first group together was the Neon Boys, consisting of Verlaine on guitar and vocals, Hell on bass and vocals and Billy Ficca on drums.[12] The group lasted from late 1972 to March 11, 1973. A 7-inch record featuring "That's All I Know (Right Now)" and "Love Comes in Spurts" was released in 1980.[13]

On March 12, 1973, the group reformed, calling themselves Television and recruiting Richard Lloyd as a second guitarist. The name, devised by Hell, was a pun on 'tell a vision' as well as a reference to reclaiming the dominant media of the era.[14] Their first gig was at the Townhouse Theatre, on March 2, 1974.[15] Their manager, Terry Ork, persuaded CBGB owner Hilly Kristal to give the band a regular gig at his club,[16] where they reportedly constructed their first stage. After playing several gigs at CBGB in early 1974,[17] they played at Max's Kansas City and other clubs, returning to CBGB in January 1975,[15] where they established a significant cult following.

Initially, songwriting was split almost equally between Hell and Verlaine, Lloyd being an infrequent contributor as well.[18] However, friction began to develop as Verlaine, Lloyd, and Ficca became increasingly confident and adept with both instruments and composition, while Hell remained defiantly untrained in his approach. Verlaine, feeling that Hell's frenzied onstage demeanor was upstaging his songs, reportedly told him to "stop jumping around" during the songs[citation needed] and occasionally refused to play Hell's songs, such as "Blank Generation", in concert. This conflict, as well as one of their songs being picked up by Island Records, led Hell to leave the group and take some of his songs with him.[19] He co-founded the Heartbreakers in 1975 with former New York Dolls Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan, later forming Richard Hell and the Voidoids.[20] Fred Smith, briefly of Blondie, replaced Hell as Television's bassist.[21]

Television made their vinyl debut in 1975 with "Little Johnny Jewel" (Parts One and Two), a 7-inch single on the independent label Ork Records, owned by their manager, Terry Ork. Lloyd apparently disagreed with the selection of this song, preferring "O Mi Amore" for their debut, to the extent that he seriously considered leaving the band.[22] Reportedly Pere Ubu guitarist Peter Laughner auditioned for his spot during this time.[23]

Television's first album, Marquee Moon, was received positively by music critics and audiences and entered the Billboard 200 albums chart – it also sold well in Europe and reached the Top 30 in many countries there. Upon its initial release in 1977, Roy Trakin wrote in the SoHo Weekly "forget everything you've heard about Television, forget punk, forget New York, forget CBGB's ... hell, forget rock and roll—this is the real item."[24] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes that the album was "revolutionary" and composed "entirely of tense garage rockers that spiral into heady intellectual territory, which is achieved through the group's long, interweaving instrumental sections."[25]

Television's second album, Adventure, was recorded and released in 1978.[26][27] Softer and more reflective than their debut album, Adventure was well received by critics despite modest sales. The members' independent and strongly held artistic visions, along with Lloyd's drug abuse and lack of commercial success,[28] led to the band's break-up in July 1978. Both Lloyd and Verlaine pursued solo careers, while Ficca became the drummer for the new wave band the Waitresses.[29]

Television reformed in 1992, released a self-titled third album and have performed live sporadically thereafter.[30] After being wooed back on stage together for the 2001 All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands, England, they played a number of dates around the world on an irregular basis.

In 2007, Lloyd announced he would be amicably leaving the band after a midsummer show in New York City's Central Park.[31] Due to an extended hospital stay recovering from pneumonia, he was unable to make the Central Park concert. Jimmy Rip substituted for him that day and was subsequently asked to join the band full-time in Lloyd's place. On July 7, 2011, the new lineup performed at the Beco 203 music festival in São Paulo, Brazil.[32] In an MTV Brazil interview, the band confirmed that an album with about ten new tracks was close to being finished, but as of 2023, that album has not surfaced.[33] In the 2010s, the band kept on touring performing Marquee Moon in its entirety; they notably did European tours in 2014 and 2016.[34] In New York in October 2015, the band performed a four-song show that lasted an hour: Village Voice reviewed it saying the highlight of the set was a new number "Persia", dubbing it "a pulsing, rhythmic exploration lasting close to 20 minutes, to which each member of the band contributed in equal strength".[35]

Verlaine died on January 28, 2023, at the age of 73.[36]

As with many emerging punk bands, the Velvet Underground was a strong influence.[37] Television also drew inspiration from minimalist composers such as Steve Reich.[38] Tom Verlaine has often cited the influence of surf bands the Ventures and Dick Dale on Television's approach to the guitar, and he has also expressed a fondness for the bands Love and Buffalo Springfield, two groups noted for their dual-guitar interplay. Television's ties to punk were underscored by their late '60s garage rock leanings; the band often covered the Count Five's "Psychotic Reaction" and the 13th Floor Elevators' "Fire Engine" in concert.[39]

Lester Bangs heard in Television's music the influence of Quicksilver Messenger Service, noting a similarity between Verlaine's guitar playing and John Cipollina's.[40] Tom Verlaine has downplayed the comparison, citing The Ventures as a more apt reference point.[41]

Though Verlaine and Lloyd were nominally "rhythm" and "lead" guitarists, they often rendered such labels obsolete by crafting interlocking parts, where the ostensible rhythm role could be as intriguing as the lead. Al Handa writes, "In Television's case, Lloyd was the guitarist who affected the tonality of the music more often than not, and Verlaine and the rhythm section the ones who gave the ear its anchor and familiar musical elements. Listen only to Lloyd, and you can hear some truly off the wall ideas being played."[42] .

Television,  American rock group that played a prominent role in the emergence of the punk–new-wave movement. With Television’s first single, “Little Johnny Jewel” (1975), and much-touted debut album, Marquee Moon (1977), the extended guitar solo found a place in a movement that generally rebelled against intricate musicianship. The principal members were Tom Verlaine (original name Thomas Miller; b. December 13, 1949, Mount Morris, New Jersey, U.S.—January 28, 2023, New York, New York), Richard Hell (original name Richard Myers; b. October 2, 1949, Lexington, Kentucky), Billy Ficca (b. 1949), Richard Lloyd (b. October 25, 1951, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), and Fred Smith (b. April 10, 1948, New York, New York).
Guitarist Verlaine (who took his name from the French Symbolist poet Paul Verlaine) and bassist Hell, former boarding-school roommates, formed the Neon Boys with drummer Ficca in New York City in the early 1970s. In 1973 guitarist Lloyd joined them; as Television they helped establish CBGB-OMFUG, a club in New York City’s Bowery, as the epicentre of a burgeoning punk scene. Principal songwriter Verlaine delivered his surreal lyrics with an elasticity that stretched from somber declarations to unearthly squeals, but what set Television apart from other punk–new-wave groups was the improvisational interplay of Verlaine and Lloyd’s guitars, which borrowed from avant-garde jazz and psychedelic rock. Patti Smith, with whom Verlaine wrote poetry and on whose debut single he played, described his guitar playing as the sound of “a thousand bluebirds screaming.”
Released in 1977, Marquee Moon caused a stir among American critics but, like its more polished follow-up, Adventure (1978), sold much better in Britain. Prior to Marquee Moon, Hell left to form the Heartbreakers (with ex-New York Doll Johnny Thunders), then fronted the Voidoids. Television disbanded in 1978, reuniting briefly in 1992 for an eponymous album and tour. The group reunited again in 2001, performing a series of live dates in the United Kingdom, before once again splitting up. Interest in the band was rekindled in 2003 when remastered recordings of Television’s back catalog were released, along with Live at the Old Waldorf, a concert album that captured the group at the end of its 1978 tour. Verlaine also pursued a solo career.

Television is the third and final album by American rock band Television. It was released in 1992, 14 years after the band's second studio album and subsequent breakup in 1978. A video for "Call Mr. Lee" was filmed and briefly aired on MTV.

Television has been generally well received by critics. Rock critic Robert Christgau wrote, "I prefer the more rocking, songful old Television, but it's a tribute to Tom Verlaine's conceptual restlessness and force of personality that in a world where alternative guitar means making noise or mixing and matching from the used bins, these four veterans have regrouped with a distinct new sonic identity. Droll, warm-hearted, sophisticated, cryptic, jazzy yet unjazzlike, they sound like nothing else—except, just a little, old Television".[3] David Fricke of Rolling Stone said, "It was worth waiting fifteen years."[5] Per Milo Miles of The New York Times, "Trying to adjust after a long layoff, these musicians have assembled a scaled-down Television, though one with exquisite design details."[6] Ira Robbins of Entertainment Weekly hailed it as "a shadowy album no less edgy or atmospheric than their first two. The band's filigree of interwoven guitar patterns has gained in maturity and refinement, but songwriter-singer Verlaine’s unique vision still comes through loud and clear."[4]

Television were a New York punk band formed by friends Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell. As the band approached success, Hell was forced out due to having too much energy and a lack of talent. That alone should tell you that Television weren’t a typical punk band.
Relatively unsung at the time, the band are now seen as one of the best bands of the bit 70s. Marquee Moon in particular has become a cult classic album. They are well known for the “co-lead” guitar parts played by Verlaine and Richard Lloyd.

They were never famous. Never popular. But, almost from the get go, Television was mythic. There was the story of Tom Miller (Verlaine) and Richard Myers (Hell) running away from boarding school to set things on fire and — maybe also — become poets. The one about them faking their way into that legendary jalopy of a bar on The Bowery. There was the history of “Marquee Moon’s” long gestation — beginning with those rickety Brian Eno demos and arriving only after their downtown peers had already beaten them to the punch. There were the stories of Verlaine’s not so secret romance with Patti Smith. And there were the catty, though probably accurate, stories of infighting between Verlaine and Hell, and then Verlaine and Richard Lloyd. As great as their music is, Television’s legend is no doubt greater.
While there is undoubtedly some truth in every one of those tales, today they sound more like New York City fables than like facts or history. Five decades after they were born, Television is part science fiction and part film noir. Semi-legendary but mostly unknowable. They mean so much to so few. And, whatever it is that Television has come to signify, it simply cannot be extricated from their scene, their city, and, ultimately, their inscrutable lead singer.
Tom Verlaine is among the most confounding frontmen in twentieth century music. He makes Jeff Mangum seem extroverted and Glenn Gould seem like a good hang. By his own admission, Verlaine wants his own image and story to disappear from his music. He is violently anti-careerist. He is bored, boring and avoidant in his rare interviews and he cowers in publicity photos. In conversation and in concert, he seems interested in sound and tone, but less so in the songs themselves, and not at all in the audience. It is a matter of record that Tom Verlaine has lived in New York most of his life and, briefly, while in his thirties, in London. What is much less clear is how a seventy year old man who sold relatively few records and released very little music since the age of forty-three has sustained himself since his legendary brush with sub-popularity.
Was Tom Verlaine a shrewd investor? Seems unlikely. Does he still make music? If he does, he keeps it hidden. Unlike Richard Hell, who has made a modest career as a writer and by “being Richard Hell,” Tom Verlaine seems more like an unemployed ghost of New York than a working musician. By his own account, he never practices guitar or really thinks about songwriting other than when he has an album that is required of him or a concert coming up. And, as the years have passed, those events are less and less frequent. It’s frankly hard to imagine what Tom Verlaine does all day. 
All of this silly guesswork begs the question: why do I even care? It’s a fair question, one I’ve considered since the first time I heard the opening chords of “See No Evil” and saw Robert Mapplethorpe’s cover photo for “Marquee Moon.” There was, of course, the music. The pinched vocals. The twin guitars. The jazzy bottom. The urgency and the violence. The celestial and the dreamy. Yes. That was all there. But, if I am being accurate and true, the appeal was in the form and idea of Tom Verlaine. He was tall and thin with an endless neck, giant hands, high cheekbones, large eyes, tousled, straight hair that he half hid behind and clothes that looked both arty and unconsidered. To see him when I was a teen, so full of confusion and hormones, and he was so cool and disaffected, was to see everything that I wished I could be. I was acned and awkward and he was effortless and handsome.
It is no coincidence that people talk about the visual style of New York’s downtown music scene of the 1970s. There was Patti Smith’s androgyny, Richard Hell’s punk and The Talking Heads’ new wave. But, in Tom Verlaine, the scene had a veritable supermodel. In his demure gaze and slender form was my own romantic, if naive, projection of adult cool. But I’d also venture that, in his image was the collective projection of a shy, poetic genius, interested in ideas more than product or fame. Like many others, I find it almost impossible to talk about the music of Television without talking about the parable of the band and the “signified” of Tom Verlaine. Unlike most of the writing I’ve read before, though, I’m copping to it up front. For the record, I struggle to talk about Television’s music free of the legend, in general, and the symbolism of Tom Verlaine, in particular.
By 1990, Television was over twelve years removed from their break-up. They were much more folk tale than rock band to me. Tom Verlaine was forty that year. He, of course, appeared older than his black and white, 1977 self, but he was still lanky and handsome. During Television’s long hiatus, Verlaine’s solo records had drifted from his iconic sound. Where there was once only guitar, bass and drums, there were now more synthesizers. His songs were shorter and more literary than poetic. His voice sounded deeper and more tired. There was a whimsy to his songs that I could not understand but that I suspected were jokes being played on the listener. 
Public interest, especially in the U.S., became so scarce that, by 1990, it was fair to wonder if Tom Verlaine really had a career at all. “The Wonder,” his solo record from that year, was not properly released in America. And, while it was not a complete embarrassment, it was something close to that. All of those suggestions that Verlaine made about not practicing guitar and not enjoying songwriting or recording and wanting to disappear from his music suddenly seemed quite literal. That year, Tom Verlaine briefly got his wish. He became a ghost. 
In early 1992, though, he released an interesting, if modest, album of instrumentals, accompanied by three quarters of Television. “Warm and Cool” showcased a deeper and more vibrant guitar tone. There was less of Television’s angular chime and more 1950s, sci-fi ambiance. There were no vocals. It was released on a label that was known for reissues and legacy artists. It seemed to be the final acknowledgment of what I already knew -- Tom Verlaine was not interested in writing or performing songs for the public any more. On the other hand, he seemed nominally willing to play guitar — but only out of curiosity and financial necessity. In 1978, Tom Verlaine retired Television. In early 1992, it seemed that he had retired Tom Verlaine.
But then, the unimaginable happened. Nobody could have predicted it because, by then, nobody was listening to Tom Verlaine and he certainly wasn’t sharing. But, quietly and casually, all four members of Television — Tom Verlaine, Fred Smith, Billy Ficca and, most notably, Richard Lloyd — began playing together again. A loyal cadre of younger admirers signed them to Capitol Records. And, in the Fall of 1992, fourteen years after “Adventure,” Television’s released their third, self-titled studio album. I was eighteen at the time and completely breathless with excitement. 
It has now been twenty eight years since that last Television album — twice as long as the time between the second and third Television albums. Television still plays “special occasion” shows, mostly well paying festival gigs or prestigious concerts in major cities around the world. Richard Lloyd left the band over a decade ago, seemingly out of impatience with Verlaine and the meandering, almost whimsical nature of the band. He was replaced by the more amicable and professional, if less dazzling, Jimmy Ripp. There have been rumors of a long-awaited fourth Television album for almost a decade. On the basis of their live shows, it would appear that the band has enough material worked out for an album's worth of songs. But, as is often the case with Tom Verlaine, there seems to be something missing — creative resolution, the right record deal, the right occasion or, simply, possibly, sufficient ambition. Whatever the issue may be, I stopped wondering. And I stopped waiting. In the interim, I reached middle age. I passed the age that Tom Verlaine was in 1992. I felt sufficiently ready to put the legend aside and to revisit Television’s “reunion” album from 1992 not as a personal moment or as a historical act of resurrection, but simply as a piece of music. 
To my 1992 ears, “Television” sounded better than most Tom Verlaine solo albums, different from previous Television records and unlike anything else being played on college radio or MTV2. Upon return, all of those observations still ring true. The first thing you notice is the bottom of Tom Verlaine’s guitar and voice. Patti Smith once noted that Verlaine’s guitar sounded like “a thousand bluebirds screaming.” In 1992, however, that instrument was less squeal and more tremolo — micd closely, so as to resemble Duane Eddy. In middle age, Television’s hooks and solos are less incendiary. They’re revealed patiently and with greater mystery, evoking vintage spy novels and Sam Fuller flicks.
The extra time and space works. They allow for audible thought — you can hear Verlaine really considering his next move en route his ultimate destination. His solos are “headier” more than they are technically astounding. But they are astounding nonetheless. And while his voice sounds nearly as deep as Leonard Cohen’s, he does still sound as though he is being strangled late at night in some dark alley in New York City. It’s all clearly still the same man, but he’s replaced speed and dreaminess with a dark, oddball sense of dramedy.
In contrast to the slower, inverted routes that Verlaine gumshoes, Richard Lloyd sounds jagged and dangerous. He plays a lot of rhythm guitar here, but he plays it with the broken shards of “Satisfaction” — if the song was performed by Robert Quine, with one hand, while on speed. It’s positively exciting to hear the taut fury of Lloyd’s rhythms against the droll playing of Verlaine. Additionally, there are several songs wherein the two guitarists trade off solos, allowing us to note and admire the contrast. In 1978, many people referred to the “dueling guitars” of Television. In 1992, it seems less like the guitars are dueling and more like they are in a conversation gone sideways, speaking a language foreign to the other. As was the case way back when, upon return their music was still unlike anything else in the idiom. If nothing else, “Television” confirmed that Tom Verlaine sounds better with Richard Lloyd than he does alone (or with a stand in). Their styles are so different and the tension so apparent that it elevates Verlaine from something unusual to something singular.
“Television” is ten songs — nearly all of which are compelling and about half of which are excellent. The opener, “1880 or So,” sounds not unlike The National if they were recorded by Rick Rubin. From the opening notes, the tone is intimate and supple. There’s the slightest jazz in the drumming. And Verlaine is loose and poetic and, of course, weird. For those who listened to “Warm and Cool” or for those familiar with Verlaine’s work on Luna’s “Twenty Three Minutes in Brussels,” the first track on Television’s long-awaited return sounds familiar and completely intoxicating. 
“Shane She Wrote This” and “Call Mr. Lee” increase the velocity and dial up the volume a notch. On the former, Verlaine jumps pedals from a vintage baritone to a whine that sounds like a cello or theremin as much as it does like a guitar. It’s a very broad jump, but also the sort that he is known for. In the and athletic pace, you can almost hear the middle-aged hipsters working up a sweat. “Call Mr. Lee,” meanwhile, was the album’s “single” (in the sense that they sent copies of it to college radio and made a video for MTV2). It’s a mini spy thriller tucked inside four minutes of Richard Lloyd’s increasing anxiety. His rhythm guitar completely freaks out inside the verses, caterwauling towards an acrobatic solo that runs up and down the fretboard in an effort to escape the song’s mysterious villains. We leave the song not knowing what actually happened to whom other than that Richard Lloyd stole Tom Verlaine’s Pop song and turned it into his own guitar showcase. 
Those three tracks are the unmistakable bullseyes of “Television,” but there is intrigue throughout. On a trio of charming, if offhanded, tunes like “In World,” “Beauty Trip” and “This Tune,” Verlaine pauses the noir and plays the whimsy. But, his version of whimsy is less “funny ha ha” and more obtuse, nervous giggles. Each of these three are relatively straightforward verse/verse/bridge/chorus numbers — except that the band sounds like their native language is Sanskrit or something from the future rather than English or The Beatles. The melodies are weird. The drums wait behind the vocals and the guitars are untethered. Even in their modest tracks, Television sounds otherworldly. And there is literally no songwriter other than Tom Verlaine who would write a Rockabilly song like “Beauty Trip” with impenetrable lyrics like:
De Soto
Has a cool shark fin
My humble abode
Hey, uh, where I've been
Bougie, Bougie
No, no applause
Four enchiladas, Senor
Extra sauce…
Just one face card and one ace
Put my game back in place
Crystal honey, where you been?
Turn a corner and my heart just goes boom-boom!
Like most everything Tom Verlaine made after “Adventure,” however, there are also half-baked ideas on “Television” — songs that would have benefited from more input and oxygen. There is a pleasant, though ultimately boring, tone poem (“Rhyme”) where Verlaine ventures into heavy breathing, Roxy Music territory. It’s a style that he would try out increasingly as he got older — searching, stream of conscious narration against the band’s loosely held improvisation. “Rocket,” meanwhile, is an experimental track built around an industrial beat and a yearning refrain of “Cherie Cherie.” Other than recalling the great Suicide song (“Cheree”), it sounds like an idea Verlaine and drummer Billy Ficca had in the studio when Richard Lloyd and Fred Smith were out for a smoke break. 
The album’s closer, “Mars,” is ostensibly a David Lynch film in song. Halting, scary, funny and beautiful, Verlaine’s vocals are unappealing, in the same way a vintage monster movie can be. The cumulative effect, however, is completely arresting. Verlaine acts out a nonsensical B-movie while he and Richard Lloyd try to toe the line between horror and delight. The last ninety seconds of the song are pure glee, with both guitarists freaking out while the singer whispers, utters and croons:
Ding-a-ling-ding-a-ling-ling-ling time to get up
Must have some coffee, let's have some caw-fee
I die a coupla times for you
I die a coupla times a night for you
In my arms so warm and smooth
Every bone in heaven moving smooth
You crack up fine and test I'm all forever
That cop, hey, that cop's from
That cop's from Mars, baby!
“Television” sounds a lot like the Tom Verlaine I projected — odd, brilliant, lazy, romantic, hot and cold. The final minute of “Mars” alone contains all of those things, and then some. As a coda for a song, it is breathtaking. As a closer to the album, it is a bit terrifying. But if it ends up being the finale to Television’s recording career — as I suspect it will — I’d say it sounds about right. Tom Verlaine couldn’t simply disappear, as he’d hoped. But maybe, finally, he could scare us all away.

    Can someone explain the difference between televisión and televisor, especially why one is feminine and the other masculine? Are they totally interchangeable or are there times when you would use one instead of the other and vice versa? Thanks in advance!

Once out of  time, always out of time: In 1977 the stunning ice-blue guitarchitecture and defiant spirit of free-jamming wanderlust on Television‘s debut album, Marquee Moon, blew wide holes through cream-puff AOR rock and the already calcifying primitivism of punk. Fifteen years later, in a guitar decade awash in thick distortion and truncheon riffing, the reunited Television comes in colors — pastel strumming, deep purple vibrato, sunrise orange chords — and celebrates the lost virtues of precision, emotional depth and sonic elegance.
The schematic remains the same. Guitarists Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd uncork spectacular, interlocking riff spirals and spin into heated solo orbit over Fred Smith’s bulwark bass playing and drummer Billy Ficca’s firm, earthy cadences. But the spaces they’ve mapped out are dark and tight, full of claustrophobic menace. Combining the focused songcraft of the band’s second album, Adventure, with Marquee Moon‘s flair for guitar melodrama, Television is rich in twang noir — meticulous weaves of pithy guitar agitation and stately sleight of tune underscored with Verlaine’s Sahara-dry wit and that unmistakable death-rattle choke in his singing. In “Call Mr. Lee,” Verlaine sounds like a snickering Peter Lorre, his voice dripping with con-man smarm and I-spy mischief (“Just one trick and/You’re sweet for life/Help me out, plum blossom”), as Lloyd’s guitar skids through the choruses in a cat’s cradle of hairpin turns. And “1880 or So” is an even more sinister beauty, the guitars’ crystalline ping and Verlaine’s polite Victorian love-speak (“Rose of my heart, the vision dims”) belied by the darker obsession encoded in his parched vocal and Lloyd’s solo outbursts.

Television‘s unexpected emphasis on restraint and layered meaning makes it hard at first to give yourself up to deviant surprises like the droll tangle of “Beauty Trip” or the opiate syncopation of “Rhyme” and “Mars.” Actually, the ’92 model Television is like a twin-guitar version of those Bulgarian women’s choirs, a model of complex, unaffected modal and melodic networking dramatically resolving into angry tremolo shivers, star-burst power chords and languid states of grace. One minute you hear Duane Eddy; the next, John Cippolina; the next, a kinder, gentler Hendrix.

But you hear it all as Television, orchestrated with impeccable clarity, sensual vigor and a gift for breathtaking understatement. In “No Glamour for Willi,” the laughing sound of Verlaine’s wah-wah break neatly mimics Willi’s playful insistence that her love has no price (“My preferences, dear, are/Mostly half-price/A four-leaf clover might be nice”). It’s a small moment but one that defines Television‘s slowly unfolding pleasures so well — all, in turn, rooted in the greater pleasure of hearing guitars speak in tongues, not just fuzz. As Verlaine puts it, perhaps a little floridly, in “Shane, She Wrote This”: “Sisters rejoice, strum the big minor chord/With wildly impassioned delight/Rapture is mine now as I behold/All turning holy and bright.” It was worth waiting fifteen years.
