Have you ever put milk, eggs, fruit, vegetables, meat or other items into your refrigerator, only to discover that your fridge is freezing food? While this problem is somewhat rare, it can happen – and when it does, you’re left with food that needs to be thawed. If you need help preventing this issue, our guide provides solutions.
Food freezing in the fridge can be triggered by a handful of causes, including everything from a faulty temperature sensor to blocked air vents, a leaky door seal and more. 
A refrigerator is designed to keep food cool for safe storage and should not freeze anything, so how do you fix a refrigerator that freezes everything? If you notice that your food freezes in the refrigerator, it may be caused by the following issues:

Troubleshoot your way through the topics below to find out what’s causing your refrigerator to freeze foods and how to fix it. Select a link below to jump to a topic.
The optimum refrigerator temperature range for storing fresh food is between 38 - 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If your food is freezing, then it is possible that your fridge’s temperature setting was accidentally set too low. This is a common problem that can lead to your refrigerator freezing food.
If your refrigerator is too cold, locate the temperature controls and adjust it accordingly. Not sure which temperature is correct? Consult your user guide or owner’s manual.
You may find that your refrigerator is set at an ideal setting for cooling foods, but your temperature sensor could still be off. To manually check your refrigerator's temperature, place a glass of water on the top shelf of your refrigerator for 24 hours. Remove the glass and test the water temperature with a cooking thermometer. If the thermometer reading isn't within 2 degrees of your set temperature, or the recommended temperature range, your refrigerator’s temperature sensor may be faulty and in need of replacing. 
Refrigerators use air vents to circulate cold air and ensure a consistent temperature throughout the storage area. In order to ensure the proper temperature, you need to allow room for proper air flow between the freezer and refrigerator compartments. If food is blocking these air vents, it will be exposed to more cold air and may freeze over time. (Blocked vents can also make it harder for your freezer to maintain temperature.)
Make sure that the food in your refrigerator isn’t touching any of the air vents. You can also try to distribute food more evenly throughout the refrigerator. To learn more about how to store food in your refrigerator, check out our Refrigerator Organization Guide Guide.
The seals around your refrigerator and freezer doors help keep cold air in. If one or both of these seals are leaking, your refrigerator will work harder to maintain a constant temperature. Unfortunately, this can lead to a refrigerator that’s too cold – and frozen food.
If you suspect that your refrigerator’s doors may be leaking, take some time to clean and inspect the door seals. If they are torn, warped or worn, replace them immediately. You’ll not only keep your refrigerator from freezing food, but you’ll save energy as well with these replacement parts from Whirlpool.
A refrigerator ice maker being put to good use shouldn’t cause freezing in the refrigerator compartment, but a dormant icemaker may be a problem. An ice maker that’s left on but disconnected from the water supply can cause the compartment to cool to freezing temperatures as it continually tries and fails to make ice.
If you don’t plan to use your ice maker then turning it off may help prevent overcooling in the refrigerator. Most refrigerator ice makers can be turned off by flipping an on/off switch located near the ice maker or by lifting the metal feeler arm up and into the off position. If your refrigerator features a touch screen menu, you may need to navigate through its settings to turn off your ice maker.
If you haven’t had success using the steps above, it may be time to schedule service for your refrigerator so a professional can take a look. If your refrigerator needs to be replaced, we can help—our Refrigerator Buying Guide can help you discover the right refrigerator for your kitchen. If you’re having the other issue and your fridge isn’t staying cool enough, learn how to troubleshoot it.

If air is blocked, the refrigerator will run longer to try to cool the areas with the sensor, causing other parts of the fridge to freeze. When the refrigerator finally stops running, the extremely cold air from the freezer can eventually flow into the bottom of the refrigerator, freezing whatever is in the crisper drawer. To stop this from happening, ensure that the vents aren't blocked and that food isn't packed so tightly inside that it prevents good airflow.
Most refrigerators have two controls: one for the refrigerator temperature and another for airflow (which controls the freezer temperature). We recommend keeping your airflow at a midrange setting and then adjusting it if you are having issues. As for the temperature, people often wonder, "How cold should a refrigerator be?" The answer: An ideal range is between 34 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. To monitor your fridge, keep a thermometer inside it. If it's set too cold, set it higher and give it a day to adjust. Be sure to only adjust the temperature in relatively low increments, checking with a thermometer every 24 hours.
A leaking seal can lead warm air to seep into the refrigerator, which can cause a refrigerator to keep demanding more cold air, which will cause some parts of the refrigerator to freeze. To test the seals, place a piece of paper in the door. Then try and pull it out. If you remove it easily, you need to either replace the seals or use petroleum jelly to provide a better one.
When the circulation fan isn't working, the freezer becomes exceptionally cold and that frigid air filters into the fridge. To fix the problem, unplug your fridge, find the circulation fan, and make sure it is spinning correctly by using a finger to rotate the fan. If the fan won't spin because it's blocked or damaged, you'll need to replace it.
Dirty coils often result in a refrigerator that is too warm — not too cold. But sometimes it can cause your fridge to work overtime and end up being colder. You can clean dust off the coils by removing the plate at the bottom or back of your refrigerator to access the coils.

You use your refrigerator to store all of your favorite fresh ingredients, but it can be frustrating to find frost on your food when you open the door. If your refrigerator is freezing food, there are several possible causes to consider. Use this guide to explore possible solutions for a refrigerator that is getting too cold and discover tips to prevent the issue in the future.
Refrigerators work to keep your food at a cool—but not freezing—temperature. Overly frosty temperatures in your refrigerator can be due to a few possible causes, including blocked air vents, incorrect temperature settings, leaky door seals, issues with your built-in ice maker and more.
If your refrigerator begins to freeze your fresh produce and meats, there are a few possible fixes you can try before calling in the professionals. Explore some potential solutions for a refrigerator that’s too cold below.
The air vents inside your refrigerator help circulate cold air throughout the interior to maintain proper cooling temperatures. If you overpack your appliance, you may have blocked the air vent. This can restrict the airflow and lead to freezing temperatures inside the refrigerator storage area. 
Organize the contents of your refrigerator and make sure your items are evenly distributed throughout the storage area and are not crowding the air vents.
Proper internal temperatures for a refrigerator range between 38–40ºF. If you notice your refrigerated food is frozen, you may need to reset the temperature settings on your appliance, following the instructions provided in the owner’s manual.
Your refrigerator door is wrapped with rubber gasket seals that help lock in cold air and maintain the refrigerator’s internal temperature. If the seal is damaged or broken, it can lead to temperature issues inside the appliance. Inspect the gasket seals for cracks, tears or any other visible sign of wear. If damage is found, the seals may need to be replaced.
If your refrigerator has a built-in ice maker, it could be the culprit behind the freezing temperatures. Ice makers that are powered on but disconnected from the water supply may continue trying to make ice, which can release too much cold air inside your refrigerator and alter the internal temperature. 
You can resolve this issue by either connecting your ice maker to a water line or by switching the power setting to the “off” position.
Proper refrigerator cleaning and maintenance includes keeping the condenser coils clear of dirt and dust. These coils can typically be found on the bottom or back of your refrigerator and they may force your refrigerator compressor to work harder to maintain temperatures if they are not kept clear of debris.
Your refrigerator’s temperature sensor gauges the interior temperature and sends a signal to the cooling system to raise or lower temperatures to keep the refrigerator working. If the sensor is broken, it can lead to poor temperature regulation inside your appliance. 
Test the sensor by placing a glass of water inside your refrigerator, then use a thermometer to check the temperature of the water after it has been refrigerated for 24 hours. If the water is cooler than your refrigerator’s temperature settings, you may need to replace the sensor.
If you have checked out the above solutions and still find that your refrigerator temperature is too low, your control panel may be in showroom or demo mode. If the control panel is the cause, you can resolve the issue by resetting your refrigerator.
Unplug the appliance and wait 5–10 minutes before plugging it back in, then set the temperature to 38–40ºF and test to see if the control panel is responding. If the panel is still not working properly, you may need the help of a professional.
The vents inside combination refrigerator freezers allow the cold air to escape from the freezer into the refrigeration area. If you have your freezer temperature set too low, it may lead to frosty temperatures in the refrigerator.
You rely on your kitchen appliances to perform at their best so you can focus on starting your next culinary adventure. Use the following tips to help prevent your refrigerator from getting too cold so you can focus on creating.
Avoid setting your refrigerator temperatures lower than 32–40º to help prevent food from freezing.
Keep your fresh ingredients organized and evenly distributed inside the refrigerator to promote proper airflow.
If you’ve tried everything listed and still can't find a resolution, you may need to schedule a repair service with a licensed professional to help you determine if you need to repair or replace your refrigerator. If you opt to replace or upgrade your refrigerator, explore the refrigerator buying guide to find the perfect match for the way you make.

If you've ever opened your fridge to find that everything inside has turned into a block of ice, you're not alone. This is a common problem that can be caused by a number of different factors. Here are some of the most common reasons why your fridge might be suddenly freezing everything, and what you can do to fix it.
 
Cause: If your fridge's temperature settings are set too low, it can cause everything inside to freeze.
Fix: Adjust the temperature settings on your fridge to be within the ideal range of 34 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
Cause: If your fridge's thermostat isn't working properly, it can't control the temperature inside. This might be due to a damaged sensor, broken wires, or a faulty control board.
Fix: Replace the thermostat or consult a technician for help.
 
Cause: Air vents in your fridge help circulate cold air. If they're blocked, the cold air can't move around, causing some areas to freeze.
Fix: Clear any obstructions around the vents and rearrange items inside the fridge to allow for better airflow. Regularly clean the vents to prevent dust and debris buildup.

Cause: If the door seal on your fridge is damaged or dirty, cold air can escape, causing the fridge to work harder and potentially freeze your food.
Fix: Inspect the door seal for damage and replace it if necessary. Clean the seal using detergent and water, then dry it thoroughly before putting it back in place.
 
Cause: When your fridge is too full, it can restrict airflow and cause uneven cooling. This can lead to some areas freezing while others stay at a normal temperature.
Fix: Organize the items inside your fridge to allow for better air circulation. Avoid stacking items on top of each other and create space between them.

Cause: If your fridge's defrost system isn't working properly, ice can build up and cause freezing.
Fix: Check the defrost components for damage or blockage. If you're unsure how to do this safely, consult a technician for assistance.
 
Q: What temperature should my fridge be set at? A: The ideal temperature for a refrigerator is between 34 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit.
Q: How do I know if my thermostat is broken? A: If everything inside your fridge has started freezing, there's a good chance that something isn't working properly with its cooling system. Check whether or not there are any lights illuminating on its control panel. If there aren't any lights on at all, this means there could be something wrong with either your power source or an internal component like wires shorting out due to corrosion caused by moisture buildup inside air vents.

Q: How often should I defrost my fridge to prevent it from freezing everything?
A: The frequency of defrosting your fridge depends on the model and usage. If you notice that frost is building up on the inside walls of your fridge or freezer, it's time to defrost it. As a general rule, you should defrost your fridge at least once a year to prevent ice buildup that can cause the fridge to overcool and freeze everything inside.

Whether you have a frost-free refrigerator or not, it can develop problems that lead to undesirable results. A refrigerator freezing food is inconvenient and can indicate the unit is improperly set or needs to be repaired. No matter the reason, it needs to be addressed immediately.
Everyone who has a refrigerator has experienced this issue at one time or another. One morning, containers of water, milk, vegetables, and fruits are frozen solid. There are several reasons this may happen. Here, we’ll run through the most common causes and the steps you can take to remedy them.
Perhaps when you were last loading groceries or removing an item, you accidentally brushed against the thermostat. This happens more easily than you think. If the temperature was inadvertently set colder, items may freeze. The mark on the adjustment knob may have worn away so you could have set the temperature differently than you intended.
This issue is among the easiest to resolve because you can simply reset the thermostat. The ideal temperature to keep food fresh, yet unfrozen, is around 36℉ to 38℉.
If the setting of your fridge is ideal for cooling foods, but they’re freezing, there could be a faulty sensor. You can check the unit’s temperature manually if you suspect this problem. To do so, fill up a glass of water and place it on the top shelf. Leave it for 24 hours and then place a cooking thermometer in the water to test its temperature. If the reading is outside 2℉ of the set temperature, the temperature sensor may need replacement.
Air vents help circulate the cold air in refrigerators. They also ensure the temperature inside is consistent. If food is blocking a vent, it can prevent air from reaching other parts of the unit, while direct exposure to the cold air source can result in a refrigerator freezing food.
Fortunately, this issue can be resolved by moving and rearranging food so that air vents aren’t blocked. Make sure nothing is touching the vents. Also, redistribute food so that it’s placed more evenly throughout the interior space. Or, if your fridge is overloaded, remove some items to improve airflow.
The doors for your refrigerator and freezer are designed with an airtight seal. But gaskets can break down over time and leak. If a seal starts to leak, the unit can potentially become too cold as it works to compensate.
Door seals should be periodically inspected and cleaned. If they look worn out, warped, or torn, replace them right away. Otherwise, you may be wasting energy. The appliance will also run constantly, which can wear it out to the point premature replacement is necessary.
A damper is an assembly that regulates how much cool air reaches the refrigerator from an integrated freezer. If it malfunctions, too much air can flow into the refrigerator compartment. The temperature then gets colder to the point that food can freeze.
You can check the damper by looking near the top of a side-by-side fridge, or in the middle of a top-mount unit. It may look like a flapper door or slide gate. If it seems stuck open, the damper is defective or a control sensor has failed or become disconnected.
Refrigerators have condenser coils mounted on the outside and evaporator coils inside. The refrigerant passes through these coils for the purpose of heat exchange. If the coils become dusty or dirty, the refrigerator must compensate for the temperature differential and can over-cool. Rather than dealing with frozen food, you can clean the coils according to the instructions in the owner’s manual.
Control board failure is less common than other problems with the same symptoms. If the temperature control board isn’t working right, it can send a constant signal to the compressor or fan motors, causing the refrigerator to become too cold. Only replace the control board if checking or fixing other potentially faulty components haven’t fixed the problem.
If the ice maker is disconnected from the water supply but left on, it can cause the refrigerator compartment to cool to below freezing. The component is still trying to make ice. But instead, it is causing your food to freeze. You can resolve this by turning the ice maker off, if not using it, via the on/off switch, metal feeler arm, or touchscreen menu.

Hi,
We have a GE Monogram Refrigerator model ZFSB25DTG SS. Not sure how old it is, it came with the house and we moved in a few weeks ago.
The fridge initially wasn't getting below 45 degrees (set to 37) and the freezer was at about 5 (set to 0). After a few days I did some poking around and discovered a lot of ice completely clogging what I think are the evaporator coils at the bottom of the fridge (behind the fresh food drawers). There was also a small amount of ice built up on the back of the freezer, but I didn't dismantle anything in the freezer.
After unplugging the fridge and letting it defrost overnight the temperature was perfect (freezer and fridge) for nearly two weeks, but then jumped back up again, and of course the ice had returned. Defrosted it again (with a hair dryer this time) and it OK for now, but I obviously need a more permanent fix.
From what I've read it sounds like it's probably a problem with the defrost system, but I can't find any specific information for this model of fridge, so I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. Can anyone give me some direction?
Thanks,
Rob Wilson.
Edit:
Top freezer, bottom fridge (can't remove styrofoam due to ice, so can only see bottom two coils).
Fridge seems to be a lot more iced up than freezer if you can see all the white behind the two coils.


Is this a good question?
Updates:
I have removed the defrost heater and measured the impedance at 20 ohms.
I have checked the thermistors and heater in diagnostic mode and they all passed.
I have followed the instructions in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrSQz-5F...
to check
1. the defrost heater and defrost thermostat (checked OK ~20 ohms).
2. the evaporator thermistor (checked OK ~ 12kOhms)
Note I'm using an analog MM not a DMM, so my measurements aren't very precise, but I'm clearly not getting an open circuit.
At this point it seems I should probably replace the main board. Is there anything else I can check before I do that?

I have similar issues and most of the blogs I've read state the first thing to do is make sure dust and pet hair aren't thickly covering the condenser coils at the back bottom of refrigerator. I have yet to purchase a condenser coil  brush to do that, but you might want to read up on that solution. Sounded as if the questioner hadn't tried that. Defrosting worked for me, also for about 2 weeks.

I couldn't find anything wrong, and didn't want to go to the trouble and expense of replacing the main board when there was no direct evidence that there was a problem with it, so I called in a repair person.
He didn't initially know what the problem might be either, but he called the manufacturer (GE) and they suggested replacing two thermistors in the fridge (fresh food compartment). I was skeptical since I'd tested the thermistors and didn't see anything wrong, but told him to go ahead since there was no charge if it didn't work. It worked.
So, if any one else has this model of fridge - or any model where the fresh food compartment (fridge) has its own evaporator coils but not its own defrost heater, then my suggestions are a) don't go messing around in the freezer, that's not where the problem is, b) make sure the evaporator fan in the fresh food compartment is working c) replace all the thermistors in the fresh food compartment.

in the picture you submitted is that what the coil looked like when you first removed the evap cover before doing anything else. if so you have an incomplete frost pattern which points to a refrigerant leak in the system. but without looking at it in person it is hard to determine. even with a leak you can still have a "functioning" refrigerator but the compressor will be running a lot longer in order to reach those temperatures. ge uses an adaptive defrost system (comp run time, door openings, evap/cabinet temp) to determine the length of defrost. but the defrost cycle is controlled by the evap thermistor which if it is out of spec can't properly defrost unit. they are cheap cut the wires and splice a new thermistor in.

I am having the same exact problem with a year old  Kitchen Aid. Same symptoms. I have protection coverage and called for help. They told me to defrost like above and we did. It has been running 24 hours plus and doing fine. 37 deg up and 0 in freezer. I Had found the same amount of ice buildup in lower fridge grille. Had to use a hair dryer.
If this works I will be surprised as I would assume whatever caused this will return. Glad I have extra four years protection and we will see if I need it whether they will be of support

We are having the same exact problem with our KitchenAid. It is only 4 years old. Unfortunately, we don't have the extended coverage. My husband just used the hair dryer as well. Is your KitchenAid still running properly, or did you have to do something else after your post?

I also have a KitchenAid. I have had to get a repair man twice, each time just after the warranty expired.  Finally figured out that the large bottom drawer is blocking the airflow and causing the ice.  Since I removed the drawer, I have had NO PROBLEMS!!! The temp in the refrigerator is now at the set point. I use that vacant area to store bottled water.

Some of these symptoms sound like club drain lines there's a little rubber nipple under the fridge by the compressor right over the drain pan they always get stuck shut and that's why the coils freeze up not always because of their fan motor thermistors or refrigerant level. Or refrigerant switching valve if you have two coils. Always make sure that drain line is not frozen over making trick you

Defrost Heater Assembly
Mfg Part # WR51X10055
If the refrigerator is not defrosting the defrost heater assembly might be burned out. Several times a day the defrost heater assembly turns on for a few minutes to melt away any frost that may have accumulated on the freezer or refrigerator evaporator coils. If the defrost heater assembly has burned out, the frost will build up on the coils and eventually no air will be able to travel through the coils to provide cooling. The defrost heater can be checked for continuity. If it doesn't have continuity it should be replaced.
Main Control Board
If the refrigerator is not defrosting, the main control board might be defective. A few times a day the control board is supposed to turn off the cooling system and turn on the defrost heater to melt away any frost that may have accumulated on the freezer evaporator coils. If the control board is defective it could cause the system to never cycle into defrost.

Thanks Mayer!
I found and tested the defrost heater - it measured about 2 ohms so I assume that means it's ok.
I've read elsewhere that a thermostat might be a problem in a case like this, is that possible also?
Are there any other tests / diagnostics I can do to narrow down the root cause?
By the way, it seems to me that a lot more ice is building up in the fridge than in the freezer, I don't know if that means anything. I tried to add a couple of photos to my original post - they're a bit small and I can't get the styrofoam off from around the fridge coils right now without breaking it because it's iced up, so those coils are hard to see.
Best Regards,
Rob Wilson
P.S. There's only one defrost heater in the freezer, right? Not a separate one in the fridge?

If it's iced up, nothing is going to work correctly.  Get a fresh start, unplug it and let the ice melt, then test.

I had let it defrost overnight, so I unplugged the defrost heater again this morning and tested continuity again and it still seems fine to me. I did mis-speak yesterday - the impedance is about 20 ohms, not 2 - I forgot about the x10 factor on the MM.

OK, I tried some diagnostic codes I found for a different GE monogram model and tested the defrost heater. Heater came on and the frost that had built up on the freezer evap coils while I'd been standing there with the door open all melted away. This would seem to explain why I don't see much frost/ice on the freezer coils, only on the FF coils. Are the FF coils supposed to EVER have frost/ice on them? There's no defrost heater for that side, so I would guess not? I also ran the thermistor self-test and all passed. I have no idea where to go from here...

DEFROST  TIMER !  I Have a Whirlpool (model # WRF560SMYB01) that's about 3 years old. French door refrigerator, bottom freezer. It started frosting up on the back panel of the freezer & icing up around the fan making a horrible noise, caused by the ice build up behind it. Took the fan cover off, defrosted it several times with a hair dryer, like every 2-4 days, than I created a system of my own with hot water & tubing which made it faster but didn't fix the problem.... Found the wiring diagram in the bottom part of the refrigerator rolled up in the back that actually has  diagnostic instructions to test your compressor, your fans & your heaters to tell you if they are working properly. All controlled by the digital control panel in your refrigerator that allows you to increase or decrease your temperature in your freezer & your fridge, also tells you when to replace your filters & such.... After I found that & figured out the coding of it,   I was able to manually defrost my freezer without pulling it out away from the wall & making a big mess with the water & tubing! I figured out it was my defrost timer because I could manually put it in defrost from the control panel in the refrigerator but it wouldn't go into defrost by itself. After that it was a matter of finding the defrost timer on the refrigerator, which I was unable to find anywhere online....So, That's why I'm here now to tell you that your Defrost timer is located in the back, bottom part of your refrigerator on the left hand side, in a white box attached to the side by a metal plate. Unscrew the metal plate pull out the entire box. (You can take the plate off , I did) There are 4 screws, remove the top of that box, inside there is a control board & it controls the defrost system, Which I just replaced & it took about 10minutes after I got the new control board. The problem would be to find a company that will sell you the control board without having any kind of license. We used to have a company called Johnstown? that would sell us parts but now for some reason, they will, but it's twice as expensive if you don't have a license. Found a place called Dey Distributors that will for a reasonable price, but not everyone has one in there area & not everyone knows or will tell you where to go, just because they want you to call a refrigerator repair company so they can charge you an arm & a leg. My Dad was in  the Heating/ Cooling
business & I would never think to call someone without looking at it myself first. Unless your Refrigerator needs Freon you can do it yourself for under half of what those guys Charge! They will charge you 60$ just to walk in the door! If I helped just one person fix there refrigerator today that would be GREAT! I was ready to push mine out the door to the curb.  Good Luck to all of you!

I have a GE side by side model gss23wstass about 8 years old.  The freezer temp started going up.  I took off the back panel inside the freezer and noticed the defrost heater would go on but only melt the bottom part of the evaporator coils.  Then ice build-up would form on the evaporator and surrounding area and would not allow heat exchange. That is why the temperature started going up. I ended up manually defrosting it a few times and read some info online and thought it might be because of the thermistor.I replaced the thermistor that clips on to the top tubing of the evaporator.  I got it on eBay for about $7.  It did the trick.  It has been working great for the last couple weeks.  Completely defrosts the evaporator. So if you have a partially melted evaporator coil it could be due to the thermistor.

I was having sort of similar issues with with my Whirlpool WRF989SDAM00.  It's a French door fridge on top with the freezer on bottom.  The issue I was having was the evaporator in the freezer was freezing up until the circulation fan blades were contacting the ice, making noise and not properly cooling the freezer.  There was a visible amount of ice in the back of the freezer near the air circulation vents.  I defrosted that thing twice until I called a service company.  All the guy did was run a self diagnosis and program the fridge to increase the defrost time (and charged me $150).  Within about 3 months, the thing froze up again.  After that, I pulled the grate off of the back of the freezer, chipped the ice off of the evaporator (wear gloves, the fins on that thing are sharp!) and deduced that the humid climate I live in (Houston, TX) and the lower settings that I had programmed into the fridge were not compatible.  I went back to the original factory settings.   The factory settings on my fridge are 37degF (Fridge) and 0degF (Freezer) as you have posted.  It may be worth increasing your settings a degree or two if you live in a humid part of the country.  This may help the defroster keep up.

I have a side by side top fridge with freezer bottom. The right hand side of the freezer is not defrosting. The left side works fine. It is a whirlpool. The drain tube has been cleaned & working. Why is one side of freezer not defrosting & other side is when both in same compartment?

I have the exact same model with the same exact problem.  Mine starts to make noise every 4-6 weeks.  After the 4th manual defrost, I called a repair man from Whirlpool and he said it's the freezer door not sealing correctly but I cannot replace the seal and have to buy a new door for $800. I said I will buy a new fridge for that price.  So I continue to defrost every 6 weeks until I am tired of it.  I live in Virginia so it's humid in the summer.  Will try increasing the temperature setting as suggested and see. I usually don't have much food in the freezer.

A few weeks ago, I had a locally recommended repair company come out to take a look at the fridge.  The issue is th bi-metal switch in the freezer.  When this switch warms up, it kicks the fridge out of the defrost cycle and prevents the freezer from getting too warm and defrosting the food.  The bi-metal switch in my fridge is opening at too low of a temperature, therefore the defrost cycle isn't on long enough to fully defrost which results in build up on the top side of the evaporator, furthest away from the heating element.  The moisture was said to be coming from a poor door seal, however we were unable to identify where there was a gap in the seal.  The crappy thing about the problem is that the bi-metal switch isn't adjustable and can't be ordered as an individual piece, only part of a full heating assembly.  My temporary work around was to install a toggle switch in parallel with the bi-metal switch.  This way I can let the fridge fully defrost over a week or two then flip the switch back.

Norfolk, Virginia- my whirlpool has ice build up at the orifice that cool air flow from the freezer, this has prevented to cool the refrigerator.  This happen 3 times already every time it's cold like 60 deg temp weather.  1st time:  I defrosted it for 24 hours and clean evaporator coils under the unit and lasted for a year.  2nd time: defrosted, clean coils but defrosted for 8 hours only and lasted 2 months. Nov 2016- defrosting again, but will try to defrost it for 24 hrs.

I had the same problem with my Whirlpool fridge. I replaced the  thermistor which snaps onto the heating element  and plugs into a  plastic connector. The repair was easy except for the removal of the  inside panel at the back of the lower freezer drawer. The drawers need  to be removed first.  It is easy to figure that out too but be gentle as  these plastic parts are brittle and can break easily. these aren't  cheap to replace so be careful. Go to PartsSelect.com for diagrams and  replacement parts. The part was $47 and I saved $300-$400 in repair  costs by doing it myself. The only tools I needed was a Philips  screwdriver.

Have you ever put milk, eggs, fruit, vegetables, meat or other items into your refrigerator, only to discover that your fridge is freezing food? While this problem is somewhat rare, it can happen – and when it does, you’re left with food that needs to be thawed. If you need help preventing this issue, our guide provides solutions.
Food freezing in the fridge can be triggered by a handful of causes, including everything from a faulty temperature sensor to blocked air vents, a leaky door seal and more. 
A refrigerator is designed to keep food cool for safe storage and should not freeze anything, so how do you fix a refrigerator that freezes everything? If you notice that your food freezes in the refrigerator, it may be caused by the following issues:

Troubleshoot your way through the topics below to find out what’s causing your refrigerator to freeze foods and how to fix it. Select a link below to jump to a topic.
The optimum refrigerator temperature range for storing fresh food is between 38 - 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If your food is freezing, then it is possible that your fridge’s temperature setting was accidentally set too low. This is a common problem that can lead to your refrigerator freezing food.
If your refrigerator is too cold, locate the temperature controls and adjust it accordingly. Not sure which temperature is correct? Consult your user guide or owner’s manual.
You may find that your refrigerator is set at an ideal setting for cooling foods, but your temperature sensor could still be off. To manually check your refrigerator's temperature, place a glass of water on the top shelf of your refrigerator for 24 hours. Remove the glass and test the water temperature with a cooking thermometer. If the thermometer reading isn't within 2 degrees of your set temperature, or the recommended temperature range, your refrigerator’s temperature sensor may be faulty and in need of replacing. 
Refrigerators use air vents to circulate cold air and ensure a consistent temperature throughout the storage area. In order to ensure the proper temperature, you need to allow room for proper air flow between the freezer and refrigerator compartments. If food is blocking these air vents, it will be exposed to more cold air and may freeze over time. (Blocked vents can also make it harder for your freezer to maintain temperature.)
Make sure that the food in your refrigerator isn’t touching any of the air vents. You can also try to distribute food more evenly throughout the refrigerator. To learn more about how to store food in your refrigerator, check out our Refrigerator Organization Guide Guide.
The seals around your refrigerator and freezer doors help keep cold air in. If one or both of these seals are leaking, your refrigerator will work harder to maintain a constant temperature. Unfortunately, this can lead to a refrigerator that’s too cold – and frozen food.
If you suspect that your refrigerator’s doors may be leaking, take some time to clean and inspect the door seals. If they are torn, warped or worn, replace them immediately. You’ll not only keep your refrigerator from freezing food, but you’ll save energy as well with these replacement parts from Whirlpool.
A refrigerator ice maker being put to good use shouldn’t cause freezing in the refrigerator compartment, but a dormant icemaker may be a problem. An ice maker that’s left on but disconnected from the water supply can cause the compartment to cool to freezing temperatures as it continually tries and fails to make ice.
If you don’t plan to use your ice maker then turning it off may help prevent overcooling in the refrigerator. Most refrigerator ice makers can be turned off by flipping an on/off switch located near the ice maker or by lifting the metal feeler arm up and into the off position. If your refrigerator features a touch screen menu, you may need to navigate through its settings to turn off your ice maker.
If you haven’t had success using the steps above, it may be time to schedule service for your refrigerator so a professional can take a look. If your refrigerator needs to be replaced, we can help—our Refrigerator Buying Guide can help you discover the right refrigerator for your kitchen. If you’re having the other issue and your fridge isn’t staying cool enough, learn how to troubleshoot it.

If air is blocked, the refrigerator will run longer to try to cool the areas with the sensor, causing other parts of the fridge to freeze. When the refrigerator finally stops running, the extremely cold air from the freezer can eventually flow into the bottom of the refrigerator, freezing whatever is in the crisper drawer. To stop this from happening, ensure that the vents aren't blocked and that food isn't packed so tightly inside that it prevents good airflow.
Most refrigerators have two controls: one for the refrigerator temperature and another for airflow (which controls the freezer temperature). We recommend keeping your airflow at a midrange setting and then adjusting it if you are having issues. As for the temperature, people often wonder, "How cold should a refrigerator be?" The answer: An ideal range is between 34 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. To monitor your fridge, keep a thermometer inside it. If it's set too cold, set it higher and give it a day to adjust. Be sure to only adjust the temperature in relatively low increments, checking with a thermometer every 24 hours.
A leaking seal can lead warm air to seep into the refrigerator, which can cause a refrigerator to keep demanding more cold air, which will cause some parts of the refrigerator to freeze. To test the seals, place a piece of paper in the door. Then try and pull it out. If you remove it easily, you need to either replace the seals or use petroleum jelly to provide a better one.
When the circulation fan isn't working, the freezer becomes exceptionally cold and that frigid air filters into the fridge. To fix the problem, unplug your fridge, find the circulation fan, and make sure it is spinning correctly by using a finger to rotate the fan. If the fan won't spin because it's blocked or damaged, you'll need to replace it.
Dirty coils often result in a refrigerator that is too warm — not too cold. But sometimes it can cause your fridge to work overtime and end up being colder. You can clean dust off the coils by removing the plate at the bottom or back of your refrigerator to access the coils.

If your refrigerator is freezing food, there are several possible causes to consider. Use this guide to explore possible solutions for a refrigerator that is getting too cold and discover tips to prevent the issue in the future.
Refrigerators work to keep your food at a cool—but not freezing—temperature. Overly frosty temperatures in your refrigerator can be due to a few possible causes, including blocked air vents, incorrect temperature settings, leaky door seals, issues with your built-in ice maker and more.
If your refrigerator begins to freeze your fresh produce and meats, there are a few possible fixes you can try before calling in the professionals. Explore some potential solutions for a refrigerator that’s too cold below.
The air vents inside your refrigerator help circulate cold air throughout the interior to maintain proper cooling temperatures. If you overpack your appliance, you may have blocked the air vent. This can restrict the airflow and lead to freezing temperatures inside the refrigerator storage area. 
Organize the contents of your refrigerator and make sure your items are evenly distributed throughout the storage area and are not crowding the air vents.
Proper internal temperatures for a refrigerator range between 38–40ºF. If you notice your refrigerated food is frozen, you may need to reset the temperature settings on your appliance, following the instructions provided in the owner’s manual.
Your refrigerator door is wrapped with rubber gasket seals that help lock in cold air and maintain the refrigerator’s internal temperature. If the seal is damaged or broken, it can lead to temperature issues inside the appliance. Inspect the gasket seals for cracks, tears or any other visible sign of wear. If damage is found, the seals may need to be replaced.
If your refrigerator has a built-in ice maker, it could be the culprit behind the freezing temperatures. Ice makers that are powered on but disconnected from the water supply may continue trying to make ice, which can release too much cold air inside your refrigerator and alter the internal temperature. 
You can resolve this issue by either connecting your ice maker to a water line or by switching the power setting to the “off” position.
Proper refrigerator cleaning and maintenance includes keeping the condenser coils clear of dirt and dust. These coils can typically be found on the bottom or back of your refrigerator and they may force your refrigerator compressor to work harder to maintain temperatures if they are not kept clear of debris.
Your refrigerator’s temperature sensor gauges the interior temperature and sends a signal to the cooling system to raise or lower temperatures to keep the refrigerator working. If the sensor is broken, it can lead to poor temperature regulation inside your appliance. 
Test the sensor by placing a glass of water inside your refrigerator, then use a thermometer to check the temperature of the water after it has been refrigerated for 24 hours. If the water is cooler than your refrigerator’s temperature settings, you may need to replace the sensor.
If you have checked out the above solutions and still find that your refrigerator temperature is too low, your control panel may be in showroom or demo mode. If the control panel is the cause, you can resolve the issue by resetting your refrigerator.
Unplug the appliance and wait 5–10 minutes before plugging it back in, then set the temperature to 38–40ºF and test to see if the control panel is responding. If the panel is still not working properly, you may need the help of a professional.
The vents inside combination refrigerator freezers allow the cold air to escape from the freezer into the refrigeration area. If you have your freezer temperature set too low, it may lead to frosty temperatures in the refrigerator.
You rely on your kitchen appliances to perform at their best so you can focus on starting your next culinary adventure. Use the following tips to help prevent your refrigerator from getting too cold so you can focus on creating.
Avoid setting your refrigerator temperatures lower than 32–40º to help prevent food from freezing.
Keep your fresh ingredients organized and evenly distributed inside the refrigerator to promote proper airflow.
If you’ve tried everything listed and still can't find a resolution, you may need to schedule a repair service with a licensed professional to help you determine if you need to repair or replace your refrigerator.

If you've ever opened your fridge to find that everything inside has turned into a block of ice, you're not alone. This is a common problem that can be caused by a number of different factors. Here are some of the most common reasons why your fridge might be suddenly freezing everything, and what you can do to fix it.
 
Cause: If your fridge's temperature settings are set too low, it can cause everything inside to freeze.
Fix: Adjust the temperature settings on your fridge to be within the ideal range of 34 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit.
 
Cause: If your fridge's thermostat isn't working properly, it can't control the temperature inside. This might be due to a damaged sensor, broken wires, or a faulty control board.
Fix: Replace the thermostat or consult a technician for help.
 
Cause: Air vents in your fridge help circulate cold air. If they're blocked, the cold air can't move around, causing some areas to freeze.
Fix: Clear any obstructions around the vents and rearrange items inside the fridge to allow for better airflow. Regularly clean the vents to prevent dust and debris buildup.
Read more: Top 9 Reasons Your Refrigerator Isn't Cooling
 
Cause: If the door seal on your fridge is damaged or dirty, cold air can escape, causing the fridge to work harder and potentially freeze your food.
Fix: Inspect the door seal for damage and replace it if necessary. Clean the seal using detergent and water, then dry it thoroughly before putting it back in place.
 
Cause: When your fridge is too full, it can restrict airflow and cause uneven cooling. This can lead to some areas freezing while others stay at a normal temperature.
Fix: Organize the items inside your fridge to allow for better air circulation. Avoid stacking items on top of each other and create space between them.

Cause: If your fridge's defrost system isn't working properly, ice can build up and cause freezing.
Fix: Check the defrost components for damage or blockage. If you're unsure how to do this safely, consult a technician for assistance.
 
Q: What temperature should my fridge be set at? A: The ideal temperature for a refrigerator is between 34 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit.
Q: How do I know if my thermostat is broken? A: If everything inside your fridge has started freezing, there's a good chance that something isn't working properly with its cooling system. Check whether or not there are any lights illuminating on its control panel. If there aren't any lights on at all, this means there could be something wrong with either your power source or an internal component like wires shorting out due to corrosion caused by moisture buildup inside air vents.

Q: How often should I defrost my fridge to prevent it from freezing everything?
A: The frequency of defrosting your fridge depends on the model and usage. If you notice that frost is building up on the inside walls of your fridge or freezer, it's time to defrost it. As a general rule, you should defrost your fridge at least once a year to prevent ice buildup that can cause the fridge to overcool and freeze everything inside.

Whether you have a frost-free refrigerator or not, it can develop problems that lead to undesirable results. A refrigerator freezing food is inconvenient and can indicate the unit is improperly set or needs to be repaired. No matter the reason, it needs to be addressed immediately.
Everyone who has a refrigerator has experienced this issue at one time or another. One morning, containers of water, milk, vegetables, and fruits are frozen solid. There are several reasons this may happen. Here, we’ll run through the most common causes and the steps you can take to remedy them.
Perhaps when you were last loading groceries or removing an item, you accidentally brushed against the thermostat. This happens more easily than you think. If the temperature was inadvertently set colder, items may freeze. The mark on the adjustment knob may have worn away so you could have set the temperature differently than you intended.
This issue is among the easiest to resolve because you can simply reset the thermostat. The ideal temperature to keep food fresh, yet unfrozen, is around 36℉ to 38℉.
If the setting of your fridge is ideal for cooling foods, but they’re freezing, there could be a faulty sensor. You can check the unit’s temperature manually if you suspect this problem. To do so, fill up a glass of water and place it on the top shelf. Leave it for 24 hours and then place a cooking thermometer in the water to test its temperature. If the reading is outside 2℉ of the set temperature, the temperature sensor may need replacement.
Air vents help circulate the cold air in refrigerators. They also ensure the temperature inside is consistent. If food is blocking a vent, it can prevent air from reaching other parts of the unit, while direct exposure to the cold air source can result in a refrigerator freezing food.
Fortunately, this issue can be resolved by moving and rearranging food so that air vents aren’t blocked. Make sure nothing is touching the vents. Also, redistribute food so that it’s placed more evenly throughout the interior space. Or, if your fridge is overloaded, remove some items to improve airflow.
The doors for your refrigerator and freezer are designed with an airtight seal. But gaskets can break down over time and leak. If a seal starts to leak, the unit can potentially become too cold as it works to compensate.
Door seals should be periodically inspected and cleaned. If they look worn out, warped, or torn, replace them right away. Otherwise, you may be wasting energy. The appliance will also run constantly, which can wear it out to the point premature replacement is necessary.
A damper is an assembly that regulates how much cool air reaches the refrigerator from an integrated freezer. If it malfunctions, too much air can flow into the refrigerator compartment. The temperature then gets colder to the point that food can freeze.
You can check the damper by looking near the top of a side-by-side fridge, or in the middle of a top-mount unit. It may look like a flapper door or slide gate. If it seems stuck open, the damper is defective or a control sensor has failed or become disconnected.
Refrigerators have condenser coils mounted on the outside and evaporator coils inside. The refrigerant passes through these coils for the purpose of heat exchange. If the coils become dusty or dirty, the refrigerator must compensate for the temperature differential and can over-cool. Rather than dealing with frozen food, you can clean the coils according to the instructions in the owner’s manual.
Control board failure is less common than other problems with the same symptoms. If the temperature control board isn’t working right, it can send a constant signal to the compressor or fan motors, causing the refrigerator to become too cold. Only replace the control board if checking or fixing other potentially faulty components haven’t fixed the problem.
If the ice maker is disconnected from the water supply but left on, it can cause the refrigerator compartment to cool to below freezing. The component is still trying to make ice. But instead, it is causing your food to freeze. You can resolve this by turning the ice maker off, if not using it, via the on/off switch, metal feeler arm, or touchscreen menu.

Hi,
We have a GE Monogram Refrigerator model ZFSB25DTG SS. Not sure how old it is, it came with the house and we moved in a few weeks ago.
The fridge initially wasn't getting below 45 degrees (set to 37) and the freezer was at about 5 (set to 0). After a few days I did some poking around and discovered a lot of ice completely clogging what I think are the evaporator coils at the bottom of the fridge (behind the fresh food drawers). There was also a small amount of ice built up on the back of the freezer, but I didn't dismantle anything in the freezer.
After unplugging the fridge and letting it defrost overnight the temperature was perfect (freezer and fridge) for nearly two weeks, but then jumped back up again, and of course the ice had returned. Defrosted it again (with a hair dryer this time) and it OK for now, but I obviously need a more permanent fix.
From what I've read it sounds like it's probably a problem with the defrost system, but I can't find any specific information for this model of fridge, so I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. Can anyone give me some direction?
Thanks,
Rob Wilson.
Edit:
Top freezer, bottom fridge (can't remove styrofoam due to ice, so can only see bottom two coils).
Fridge seems to be a lot more iced up than freezer if you can see all the white behind the two coils.


Is this a good question?
Updates:
I have removed the defrost heater and measured the impedance at 20 ohms.
I have checked the thermistors and heater in diagnostic mode and they all passed.
I have followed the instructions in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrSQz-5F...
to check
1. the defrost heater and defrost thermostat (checked OK ~20 ohms).
2. the evaporator thermistor (checked OK ~ 12kOhms)
Note I'm using an analog MM not a DMM, so my measurements aren't very precise, but I'm clearly not getting an open circuit.
At this point it seems I should probably replace the main board. Is there anything else I can check before I do that?

I have similar issues and most of the blogs I've read state the first thing to do is make sure dust and pet hair aren't thickly covering the condenser coils at the back bottom of refrigerator. I have yet to purchase a condenser coil  brush to do that, but you might want to read up on that solution. Sounded as if the questioner hadn't tried that. Defrosting worked for me, also for about 2 weeks.

I couldn't find anything wrong, and didn't want to go to the trouble and expense of replacing the main board when there was no direct evidence that there was a problem with it, so I called in a repair person.
He didn't initially know what the problem might be either, but he called the manufacturer (GE) and they suggested replacing two thermistors in the fridge (fresh food compartment). I was skeptical since I'd tested the thermistors and didn't see anything wrong, but told him to go ahead since there was no charge if it didn't work. It worked.
So, if any one else has this model of fridge - or any model where the fresh food compartment (fridge) has its own evaporator coils but not its own defrost heater, then my suggestions are a) don't go messing around in the freezer, that's not where the problem is, b) make sure the evaporator fan in the fresh food compartment is working c) replace all the thermistors in the fresh food compartment.

in the picture you submitted is that what the coil looked like when you first removed the evap cover before doing anything else. if so you have an incomplete frost pattern which points to a refrigerant leak in the system. but without looking at it in person it is hard to determine. even with a leak you can still have a "functioning" refrigerator but the compressor will be running a lot longer in order to reach those temperatures. ge uses an adaptive defrost system (comp run time, door openings, evap/cabinet temp) to determine the length of defrost. but the defrost cycle is controlled by the evap thermistor which if it is out of spec can't properly defrost unit. they are cheap cut the wires and splice a new thermistor in.

I am having the same exact problem with a year old  Kitchen Aid. Same symptoms. I have protection coverage and called for help. They told me to defrost like above and we did. It has been running 24 hours plus and doing fine. 37 deg up and 0 in freezer. I Had found the same amount of ice buildup in lower fridge grille. Had to use a hair dryer.
If this works I will be surprised as I would assume whatever caused this will return. Glad I have extra four years protection and we will see if I need it whether they will be of support

We are having the same exact problem with our KitchenAid. It is only 4 years old. Unfortunately, we don't have the extended coverage. My husband just used the hair dryer as well. Is your KitchenAid still running properly, or did you have to do something else after your post?

I also have a KitchenAid. I have had to get a repair man twice, each time just after the warranty expired.  Finally figured out that the large bottom drawer is blocking the airflow and causing the ice.  Since I removed the drawer, I have had NO PROBLEMS!!! The temp in the refrigerator is now at the set point. I use that vacant area to store bottled water.

Some of these symptoms sound like club drain lines there's a little rubber nipple under the fridge by the compressor right over the drain pan they always get stuck shut and that's why the coils freeze up not always because of their fan motor thermistors or refrigerant level. Or refrigerant switching valve if you have two coils. Always make sure that drain line is not frozen over making trick you

Defrost Heater Assembly
Mfg Part # WR51X10055
If the refrigerator is not defrosting the defrost heater assembly might be burned out. Several times a day the defrost heater assembly turns on for a few minutes to melt away any frost that may have accumulated on the freezer or refrigerator evaporator coils. If the defrost heater assembly has burned out, the frost will build up on the coils and eventually no air will be able to travel through the coils to provide cooling. The defrost heater can be checked for continuity. If it doesn't have continuity it should be replaced.
Main Control Board
If the refrigerator is not defrosting, the main control board might be defective. A few times a day the control board is supposed to turn off the cooling system and turn on the defrost heater to melt away any frost that may have accumulated on the freezer evaporator coils. If the control board is defective it could cause the system to never cycle into defrost.

Thanks Mayer!
I found and tested the defrost heater - it measured about 2 ohms so I assume that means it's ok.
I've read elsewhere that a thermostat might be a problem in a case like this, is that possible also?
Are there any other tests / diagnostics I can do to narrow down the root cause?
By the way, it seems to me that a lot more ice is building up in the fridge than in the freezer, I don't know if that means anything. I tried to add a couple of photos to my original post - they're a bit small and I can't get the styrofoam off from around the fridge coils right now without breaking it because it's iced up, so those coils are hard to see.
Best Regards,
Rob Wilson
P.S. There's only one defrost heater in the freezer, right? Not a separate one in the fridge?

If it's iced up, nothing is going to work correctly.  Get a fresh start, unplug it and let the ice melt, then test.

I had let it defrost overnight, so I unplugged the defrost heater again this morning and tested continuity again and it still seems fine to me. I did mis-speak yesterday - the impedance is about 20 ohms, not 2 - I forgot about the x10 factor on the MM.

OK, I tried some diagnostic codes I found for a different GE monogram model and tested the defrost heater. Heater came on and the frost that had built up on the freezer evap coils while I'd been standing there with the door open all melted away. This would seem to explain why I don't see much frost/ice on the freezer coils, only on the FF coils. Are the FF coils supposed to EVER have frost/ice on them? There's no defrost heater for that side, so I would guess not? I also ran the thermistor self-test and all passed. I have no idea where to go from here...

DEFROST  TIMER !  I Have a Whirlpool (model # WRF560SMYB01) that's about 3 years old. French door refrigerator, bottom freezer. It started frosting up on the back panel of the freezer & icing up around the fan making a horrible noise, caused by the ice build up behind it. Took the fan cover off, defrosted it several times with a hair dryer, like every 2-4 days, than I created a system of my own with hot water & tubing which made it faster but didn't fix the problem.... Found the wiring diagram in the bottom part of the refrigerator rolled up in the back that actually has  diagnostic instructions to test your compressor, your fans & your heaters to tell you if they are working properly. All controlled by the digital control panel in your refrigerator that allows you to increase or decrease your temperature in your freezer & your fridge, also tells you when to replace your filters & such.... After I found that & figured out the coding of it,   I was able to manually defrost my freezer without pulling it out away from the wall & making a big mess with the water & tubing! I figured out it was my defrost timer because I could manually put it in defrost from the control panel in the refrigerator but it wouldn't go into defrost by itself. After that it was a matter of finding the defrost timer on the refrigerator, which I was unable to find anywhere online....So, That's why I'm here now to tell you that your Defrost timer is located in the back, bottom part of your refrigerator on the left hand side, in a white box attached to the side by a metal plate. Unscrew the metal plate pull out the entire box. (You can take the plate off , I did) There are 4 screws, remove the top of that box, inside there is a control board & it controls the defrost system, Which I just replaced & it took about 10minutes after I got the new control board. The problem would be to find a company that will sell you the control board without having any kind of license. We used to have a company called Johnstown? that would sell us parts but now for some reason, they will, but it's twice as expensive if you don't have a license. Found a place called Dey Distributors that will for a reasonable price, but not everyone has one in there area & not everyone knows or will tell you where to go, just because they want you to call a refrigerator repair company so they can charge you an arm & a leg. My Dad was in  the Heating/ Cooling
business & I would never think to call someone without looking at it myself first. Unless your Refrigerator needs Freon you can do it yourself for under half of what those guys Charge! They will charge you 60$ just to walk in the door! If I helped just one person fix there refrigerator today that would be GREAT! I was ready to push mine out the door to the curb.  Good Luck to all of you!

I have a GE side by side model gss23wstass about 8 years old.  The freezer temp started going up.  I took off the back panel inside the freezer and noticed the defrost heater would go on but only melt the bottom part of the evaporator coils.  Then ice build-up would form on the evaporator and surrounding area and would not allow heat exchange. That is why the temperature started going up. I ended up manually defrosting it a few times and read some info online and thought it might be because of the thermistor.I replaced the thermistor that clips on to the top tubing of the evaporator.  I got it on eBay for about $7.  It did the trick.  It has been working great for the last couple weeks.  Completely defrosts the evaporator. So if you have a partially melted evaporator coil it could be due to the thermistor.

I was having sort of similar issues with with my Whirlpool WRF989SDAM00.  It's a French door fridge on top with the freezer on bottom.  The issue I was having was the evaporator in the freezer was freezing up until the circulation fan blades were contacting the ice, making noise and not properly cooling the freezer.  There was a visible amount of ice in the back of the freezer near the air circulation vents.  I defrosted that thing twice until I called a service company.  All the guy did was run a self diagnosis and program the fridge to increase the defrost time (and charged me $150).  Within about 3 months, the thing froze up again.  After that, I pulled the grate off of the back of the freezer, chipped the ice off of the evaporator (wear gloves, the fins on that thing are sharp!) and deduced that the humid climate I live in (Houston, TX) and the lower settings that I had programmed into the fridge were not compatible.  I went back to the original factory settings.   The factory settings on my fridge are 37degF (Fridge) and 0degF (Freezer) as you have posted.  It may be worth increasing your settings a degree or two if you live in a humid part of the country.  This may help the defroster keep up.

I have a side by side top fridge with freezer bottom. The right hand side of the freezer is not defrosting. The left side works fine. It is a whirlpool. The drain tube has been cleaned & working. Why is one side of freezer not defrosting & other side is when both in same compartment?

I have the exact same model with the same exact problem.  Mine starts to make noise every 4-6 weeks.  After the 4th manual defrost, I called a repair man from Whirlpool and he said it's the freezer door not sealing correctly but I cannot replace the seal and have to buy a new door for $800. I said I will buy a new fridge for that price.  So I continue to defrost every 6 weeks until I am tired of it.  I live in Virginia so it's humid in the summer.  Will try increasing the temperature setting as suggested and see. I usually don't have much food in the freezer.

A few weeks ago, I had a locally recommended repair company come out to take a look at the fridge.  The issue is th bi-metal switch in the freezer.  When this switch warms up, it kicks the fridge out of the defrost cycle and prevents the freezer from getting too warm and defrosting the food.  The bi-metal switch in my fridge is opening at too low of a temperature, therefore the defrost cycle isn't on long enough to fully defrost which results in build up on the top side of the evaporator, furthest away from the heating element.  The moisture was said to be coming from a poor door seal, however we were unable to identify where there was a gap in the seal.  The crappy thing about the problem is that the bi-metal switch isn't adjustable and can't be ordered as an individual piece, only part of a full heating assembly.  My temporary work around was to install a toggle switch in parallel with the bi-metal switch.  This way I can let the fridge fully defrost over a week or two then flip the switch back.

Norfolk, Virginia- my whirlpool has ice build up at the orifice that cool air flow from the freezer, this has prevented to cool the refrigerator.  This happen 3 times already every time it's cold like 60 deg temp weather.  1st time:  I defrosted it for 24 hours and clean evaporator coils under the unit and lasted for a year.  2nd time: defrosted, clean coils but defrosted for 8 hours only and lasted 2 months. Nov 2016- defrosting again, but will try to defrost it for 24 hrs.

I had the same problem with my Whirlpool fridge. I replaced the  thermistor which snaps onto the heating element  and plugs into a  plastic connector. The repair was easy except for the removal of the  inside panel at the back of the lower freezer drawer. The drawers need  to be removed first.  It is easy to figure that out too but be gentle as  these plastic parts are brittle and can break easily. these aren't  cheap to replace so be careful. Go to PartsSelect.com for diagrams and  replacement parts. The part was $47 and I saved $300-$400 in repair  costs by doing it myself. The only tools I needed was a Philips  screwdriver.

I have a Frigidaire side by side unit that is just around 2 years old. Yesterday evening we noticed the freezer side was cold but the food was thawing. Took everything out and put in a chest freezer. Today we checked for dust on coils, ice froze on interior components, door seal problems....everything seemed fine. The compressor seems to be constantly kicking on and off and sounds alot louder than usual, but the fridge is working just fine....still maintaining it's temperature and cold as usual. I was thinking if the compressor was the problem we would be experiencing fridge problems, too? I also keep reading that the fridge gets it's cold air from the freezer so if the freezer isn't working then the fridge won't run properly either, but that's not the case here. Suggestions on what the problem may be?
Mine has an air channel between the two compartments that can freeze up (it happens if someone fails to close the door fully, leading to excess humidity).  Then, everything goes haywire.  Worse, the ice is invisible until it really builds up.
We have the same brand and it is a PITA. It needs to keep the air moving inside the case. If the air does not circulate it will create the problem you have. There is in ours, a charcoal filter that needs to be changed every 6 months, otherwise it restricts the airflow. Items inside the fridge part needs to be away from the back wall and the filter so air moves.
The logic is, yes the fridge part is cold enough, the struggling freezer part can maintain the 38 or so degrees to keep the fridge proper, but without circulation, the freezer can't do what it needs to get down to 0 degrees. 
If yours has a charcoal filter remove it and the temp should return to normal. It will cause no harm, I had to do it myself and I ordered filters online to replace it.

If items in your refrigerator are freezing, try these items:
The best temperature for food storage is 38° F to 40° F in the refrigerator section and 0° F to 2° F in the freezer section. If food in the refrigerator section is freezing, adjusting the refrigerator and the freezer controls may be necessary. Begin adjustment with the freezer control, one temperature level at a time. Allow 8 hours for temperature adjustment before setting the control to the next level. Refer to Owner's Manual for further instructions on temperature adjustment.
To ensure proper temperature, you must allow room for airflow between the freezer and refrigerator compartments. Cool air enters and exits the refrigerator compartment from the freezer compartment through vents. Depending on your model, these vents are in different locations. In the refrigerator compartment, items placed directly in the path of the freezer air flow may freeze.

Verify that the ice maker is turned on. If the water supply is not connected to the water supply line, turn the ice maker off.  
If the ice maker remains on and not connected to the water supply, the following could potentially happen:

It’s the middle of summer — and your fridge is freezing everything! You might be wondering why this is happening, and what you can do about it. In this article, we’ll explore some possible reasons why your fridge is freezing, and we’ll give you some tips on what you should do when you notice this issue.
There are many reasons why your fridge might be freezing everything, but here are four common ones you might run into.
One reason your fridge might be freezing everything is that the temperature is set too low. Your fridge has a thermostat that controls how cold it gets, and if the thermostat is set too low, it can cause your fridge to get too cold and freeze everything inside.
Another reason your fridge might be freezing everything is that the door isn't closing properly. If the door isn't sealing correctly, cold air can escape and warm air can enter. This can cause the temperature inside the fridge to fluctuate, causing the refrigerator to work extra hard and eventually freeze everything inside.
A third reason your fridge might be freezing everything is that it's too full. If there's not enough room for air to circulate, the cold air can get trapped and cause things to freeze.
A fourth reason why your fridge might be freezing everything is that something inside may be broken or not functioning properly. The most common culprits are the evaporator coils, condenser coils and compressors. If any of these parts are damaged or not working correctly, it can cause your fridge to freeze everything inside. 
Make sure to keep these reasons in mind as you investigate what might be causing your fridge to freeze everything and are potentially considering if you need to shop for a new fridge. Here at Acima Leasing we want to make sure you know how to take care of your fridge and where to go if you do happen to need or want a new appliance. 
How to Prevent Your Fridge from Freezing
Prevention is the first line of defense against a fridge that freezes everything. If your fridge has a temperature-control setting, make sure it's set to the warmest setting that will still keep your food chilled and safe to eat. Make sure that you’re regularly monitoring your fridge's temperature and making sure things aren't getting too cold.
If your fridge has an automatic defrost cycle, make sure that it’s working properly. If it doesn't, then you’ll need to manually defrost your fridge on a regular basis, in order to ensure that everything is working at peak performance.
If your fridge freezes everything — don't worry! There are a number of things you can do to fix the problem and prevent it from happening again. Here are six ideas to try when you notice that your fridge is freezing food.
First and foremost, check your fridge's temperature settings. It's possible that someone in your household inadvertently turned the fridge's temperature to a colder setting than what it should be. This will cause everything inside the fridge to become frozen.
If you find that the temperature settings are too low, turn them up to a higher setting. This will help thaw out the food that's already frozen and prevent any more food from freezing. You’ll also want to make sure that any food in the fridge during this time is still good to eat.
You’ll also want to check to see if the fridge door is closing properly. If it's not, then that could be the reason why everything in the fridge is freezing over. If your fridge is kept in an unheated area like a garage, cold air could be coming into the fridge and causing everything to freeze. Alternatively, the lack of a seal on the fridge door could be causing the fridge to work overtime by trying to keep everything cool , if the fridge is kept in a garage during the heat of the summer.
If you find that the fridge door isn't closing properly, try adjusting it or see if there is something blocking the door from closing all the way. You may also need to replace the door seal if it's not sealing properly.
Another reason your fridge may be freezing everything could be because the coils and condenser fan are dirty. If these aren't cleaned on a regular basis, they can start to cause problems with the fridge. The coils help to regulate the temperature in the fridge, and the condenser fan helps to circulate the air. If either of these are dirty, it can make the fridge work harder than it needs to, causing the temperature inside to fluctuate. This can lead to everything in the fridge freezing over.
If you have a fridge and freezer combo, then it's possible that the freezer is the reason why everything in the fridge is freezing. If the freezer is full of ice, it can cause the air to circulate differently and cause the fridge to get too cold.
To fix this, you’ll need to defrost the freezer. This can be done by unplugging the fridge and removing all the food from the fridge and freezer. Then, you’ll need to use a hairdryer or a heat lamp to melt the ice. Once the ice is melted, you can clean out the freezer and plug the fridge back in.
If your fridge is still freezing everything, even after you've tried all these other ideas, then you may need to add insulation to the door. This will help keep the cold air from escaping and will help keep the fridge at a consistent temperature. To add insulation, you can use weatherstripping or foam tape to seal up any gaps around the door. You may also need to add a new door seal if the old one is worn out.
If you've tried all the other tips and nothing seems to be working, then it may be time to get a new refrigerator! A fridge that’s too old can start to have problems. It's also possible that your fridge is too small for your needs, and that's why everything is freezing.
If you think it's time for a new fridge, then start shopping around for one that will fit your needs. You may also want to talk to a professional to see if they think a new fridge is the best option.
If your fridge is on its last leg and needs to be replaced, Acima Leasing can help. We offer an alternative to financing for new appliances, so you can get the fridge you need without using credit. We also allow smaller manageable lease renewal payment options*— so you can get the fridge you need without having to worry about a difficult approval process. If you make the number of payments defined under your lease or exercise an option to purchase it early at a discount, it’s yours! If you find out that you no longer need the fridge, you can simply return it in good condition at any time without further requirements. If you have more questions check out further details on how Acima Leasing works here and on our FAQ page.
Typically, a refrigerator should last around 10 to 12 years. However, this can vary depending on the type of fridge and how well it's been maintained.
With the advent of new technologies and hardware updates, newer fridges may not last as long as some older ones. This is because the newer fridges are not necessarily built to last as long as the older fridges, and they may not have the same quality of construction. Additionally, new technologies and updates can put a lot of stress on a fridge and cause it to break down sooner.
While there is no right or wrong way to organize your fridge, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you should put the food you use the most at eye level so that it's easy to grab. Second, you should put the food that expires first in the front of the fridge so that you can use it up before it goes bad. Finally, you should try to keep your fridge decluttered as much as possible so that air can circulate properly.
No. The depth of a fridge is measured from the front of the door to the back wall of the fridge, and it does not include the handles.
Ideally, a fridge should be between 34 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Anything lower than 34 degrees Fahrenheit can cause food to freeze, and anything higher than 40 degrees Fahrenheit can cause food to spoil.

It can be quite disconcerting to open your refrigerator in the morning and find that bottle of milk you put in there yesterday is now frozen solid. Your first thought might be that the milk has expired, but when you look at your soda bottles, vegetables, fruit and other items, it is easy to see that they are also looking frozen. This can not only cause you to spend more on groceries, but it is a sure sign that something is wrong with your refrigerator. Here are 5 reasons why your appliance may be freezing everything.
The thermostat on your refrigerator is easy to move and can be accidentally turned up when you’re loading in groceries or moving items out of the refrigerator. You may have intentionally turned up the thermostat if you felt the refrigerator wasn’t quite cool enough. Most refrigerators have a mark on the thermostat adjustment knob, but over time this gets erased. This means that there is no longer a way to accurately measure the indicating temperature. So, you may have set the thermostat way higher than you intended, not only causing everything to become frozen, but also creating higher energy use and bigger bills.
The gasket is a lining for the refrigerator door, creating a seal for the compartment, preventing heat being exchanged between the room and the inside of the refrigerator. If a gasket has become damaged and is leaking, your refrigerator will be continuously running to compensate, and this will cause everything inside to start to freeze. There is an easy way to test if you have a bad gasket; trap a piece of paper in the door and then try and pull it out without opening the door. If the paper easily slides out or won’t hold in place, you have a bad gasket that needs to be replaced.
The heat exchanger and condenser coils are mounted on the outside of your refrigerator in addition to the evaporator coils inside the unit. These coils are needed to allow the refrigerant fluid to perform its task of heat exchange. When these coils get covered in dust or other forms of dirt, it forces the refrigerator to work harder and harder to sustain the optimum temperature. Unfortunately, this can sometimes lead to overcooling and the effects of winter inside your refrigerator. The coils are fairly simple to clean; you will find instructions in your owner’s manual, and it is a good idea to clean them regularly to avoid future problems.
Thermostats are designed to trigger cooling as necessary. In a refrigerator, it should stop functioning automatically as soon as the set temperature is achieved. This is essential to maintain the desired and fixed temperature. When your thermostat develops a fault, it may fail to switch off causing it to continually run.
If you have a fridge freezer, you may be familiar with a damper. This is basically the assembly needed to regulate the amounts of cooled air entering the refrigerator from the freezer. If the damper is malfunctioning, it can create excess air that flows into the refrigerator compartment, causing a gradual decrease in temperature. If you suspect you may have damper problems, you’ll need the expertise of an experienced appliance repair specialist.
If you’re having issues with your refrigerator, a professional home appliance repair specialist can offer effective and long lasting solutions. For assistance will all your refrigerator repair needs, be sure to speak to a professional home appliance repair service.

Earlier today I noticed that a bottle of juice I put in the fridge last night wasn't cold. The temperature control for the freezer said -10 (should be 0) and the fridge said 57 (should be 37). I've tried to reset the controls, to no avail. I unplugged it, vacuumed off the back (although there wasn't much to vacuum) and plugged it in again. It's only getting warmer. Any ideas? I don't remember exactly when I bought the fridge, but I believe it's less than 10 years old.
UPDATE: The fridge is 7 years old. Also, the freezer is now at 2 and the fridge is at 63. So the temp of the freezer is moving in the right direction, but the fridge is definitely not.
I sure hope AB Cellars sees this. He was amazing when I posted about my clothes dryer.
ANOTHER UPDATE: The GE Technician just arrived. It's the freezer sensor (aka thermistor). I'm getting 50% off parts and labor, so my total cost is $146.77 (including the service call).
Thanks everyone for your help! Mayer... you nailed it. The evaporator coils were covered in ice.
Is this a good question?
PLEASE I NEED HELP i bought this refrigerator, stainless steel cafe double door with the freezer at the bottom, the freezer works well but the refrigerator does not its blowing hot air, i don't have a warranty cause i bought it ised, and the stupid people took all the labels off the fridge, and i don't even know the model number so GE won't  even come look at it, i have done some research just to find the make an model of my fridge, so now i have that so can you please give me a sense of direction what could be wrong. Thank You hope to hear from someone soon.

Poor cooling is often the result of a heavy frost build-up on the evaporator coils or a condenser that is clogged with dust, lint, and dirt.
Evaporator coils
Poor cooling is often the result of a heavy frost build-up on the evaporator coils. You can't see these coils without removing a panel on the inside of your freezer. A sure sign that there is a build-up is the presence of any frost or ice build-up on the inside walls, floor, or ceiling of the freezer. Such a frost build-up usually indicates a problem in the self-defrosting system or damaged door gaskets.
The refrigerator is supposed to self-defrost approximately four times in every 24 hour period. If one of the components in the self-defrosting system fails, the refrigerator continues to try to cool. Eventually, though, so much frost builds up on the evaporator coils that the circulating fan can't draw air over the coils. There may still be a small amount of cooling because the coils are icy, but with no air flow over the coils, cooling in the refrigerator compartment is quite limited.
Here's an inexpensive, though inconvenient, way to determine if the problem is with the self-defrosting system. Remove all of the perishable food from the refrigerator and freezer, turn the thermostat in the refrigerator to Off, and leave the doors open for 24 to 48 hours. (Be sure to have several towels ready in case the melting frost and ice causes the drip pan to overflow). This allows the refrigerator to defrost "manually." When the frost and ice build-up has completely melted away, turn the thermostat back to a normal setting. If the refrigerator then cools properly, it indicates a problem with one of three components in the self-defrosting system:
The defrost timer
The defrost thermostat (also called the bi-metal switch)
If it still does not cool properly, there may be a problem with the refrigerant level or the compressor. You may need to consult with a qualified appliance repair technician to further diagnose the problem
Condenser
Self-defrosting refrigerators all have a set of coils and a cooling fan, usually under the refrigerator, that need to be cleaned regularly. If these coils get coated with dust, dirt or lint, the refrigerator may not cool properly. The coils may appear to be a thin, black, wide radiator-like device behind the lower kick-panel. To clean them, disconnect the refrigerator from the power source, use a refrigerator condenser brush and your vacuum cleaner to clean the coils of any lint, pet hair, etc. You may not be able to get to all of the condenser from the front, it may be necessary to clean the remainder of the condenser from the rear of the refrigerator.
You didn’t say what brand/model you have, but check out the LG fridge not cooling page for more ideas—most of them are not brand-specific at all, so they may apply to your situation.

Mayer's answer is spot on here. Given the era of the refrig, your best way to determine the root of the problem is to put it in diagnostic mode. How to do that can be found in the service manual or perhaps calling the manufacturer customer service, Whirlpool at one time put it in the owners manual. Most likely cause here is related to air flow. as you have 2F in the freezer. You could have a blocked air port, bad evaporator fan, bad door switch, temperature sensor or controller board.

Kathy, there is a circulator fan blowing from the freezer into most fridge compartments.  Do and did you used to hear/feel this little fan blowing when you open the door?  Sounds like the fan has locked up and needs replacement.  You have good cooling if the freezer is 2F.  The fridge compartment temp control just opens and closes a shutter this fan blows through to cool the unfrozen stuff.....

90%+ of modern, frost free, residential refrigerators turn off the evaporator fan when the refrigerator door is opened. You will need to hold the door switch closed to check for air flow there.

how you guys are doing. Today i had my fridge check and i kinda had an idea of what the problem was. I went on youtube and google it to find some kind of idea of what the problem was but none of them weren't. In one occasion someone on youtube mention that it could be a relay malfuntioning; and guess what it turned out to be the relay capasitor that operates the compressor. I am glad i didnt buy a new fridge. I did pay the technician for checking that out thou but it wasn't much. so if your fridge isn't cooling check your compressor relay

Where is this compressor relay located? The freezer is fine but the fridge is reading 57 degrees. I defrosted it this past weekend of April the 5th. Then used towels and a low setting hair dryer to dry it out.  Then turned it back on. Freezer is working but fridge air flow is. ot cooling like it should.

@sue3772 ,
What is the make and model number of the refrigerator?
The compressor relay is not your problem.
The relay is there just to start the compressor operating and since you say the freezer temp is OK but not the fridge temp the compressor must be running OK. The “cold temperature” is generated in the freezer compartment and then transferred to the refrigerator section by the evaporator fan and air damper.
Was there a lot of ice in the freezer compartment? If so it may be that the auto defrost is not working and the evaporator fan is icing over and is stopped, preventing cold air from being blown into the refrigerator compartment, to cool it down to the set temperature.
If the compressor is running, the evap fan should be running. It is located inside the freezer compartment behind a panel. Place an ear next to the refrigerator and listen for it running. It will stop if a door is opened (any door) and start again when the doors are shut.
Do not confuse this fan with the condenser fan which is outside the compartments near the compressor motor and can be running even if the doors are open. It is there to cool the condenser coils if they are getting too warm
If you can't hear the evaporator fan at all, then it may be faulty or iced over etc.
If it is iced over this may be due to a faulty defrost heater, a blocked drain pipe below the evap unit, preventing defrost meltwater from going to the evap pan outside under the fridge, a faulty defrost thermostat or a faulty control board.

I have an old GE Eterna Series. It started having problems cooling after working great for about 7 years (of course after the warranty expired). Once I took apart the freezer to melt off the frost and ice that had built up, the refrigerator would start getting cold again. It didn't take that long for me to fix. It would last for several weeks or a few months before I'd need to do it all over again. Now, it's down to every few weeks. I've finally decided that I'll get a new LG fridge. GE may have some good products, but refrigerators certainly aren't included! All other brands that I've seen have lasted a lot longer than mine has!

A 1934 GE "Monitor Top" I inherited from my grandmother's kitchen sits in the garage, full of beer for "emergencies".  I remember she had it serviced when I was around 10.  That would have been 1956.  I think GE USED to make great fridges before the EPA bureaucrats put a stop to it.  If you have one, be informed that turning the thermostat above 2 will turn the beer into ice.  Been there, done that.
Not only is it probably illegal to be in possession of this device full of either outlawed freon or ammonia, but they'll come take me away to get their hands on it to destroy it....

I have had GE products in my house for over 40 years. I gave our first range and refrigerator to my nephew after we had it for 25 plus years with no trouble. We bought the GE Profile refrigerator, range, and dish washer in 2000 when we remodeled our kitchen. We have had no trouble until we came back from our Son's house, after Thanksgiving, to find everything thawed out in the freezer and a warm refrigerator. A GE trained service technician found the freezer drain tube frozen, not allowing subsequent defrosting melt to drain and froze the circulating fan solid. At first, I was told that because there was no access to this tube, if it kept clogging up, we would have to buy a new unit. A January 6, 2015 bulletin said hooking up the spare drain tube heater and changing the defrost timer would correct this problem. We're back to square one, with the fan freezing up in 12 days after it was "fixed". The technician said he has never seen a Profile unit built like mine! GE's answer... buy a new one. It can't be fixed.

Look at the condenser coils, located at the bottom of the refrigerator (behind the kick plate) or, in some cases, at the back. These coils disperse heat from inside the refrigerator out into the room with the aid of a fan. If the coils are dirty, the refrigerator won’t operate efficiently.

It might also be the defrost heater coils too
I had a GE Profile 30 with a similar problem.   "Luckily" I could see some of the frost (or rime ice) building up on the back, which signaled to me that the defrost had gone (if it was the seal that had gone, I would have expected the ice to build up in the front).
In my case it was actually the defrost heater or "tube" that had failed.
To determine if the is the thermostat or heater that has failed you can do an electrical continuity test with an Multimeter/Ohm-meter.  If the connection between the two sides of the heater is open, then the heater has failed.
In the case of this GE unit the heater assembly comes with a new defrost thermostat.  It is easier to repair this assembly than the thermostat itself.  And,  a generic version of the assembly costs about the  same as the  "official" GE thermostat (which makes it almost an obvious decision).    Indeed, I am grateful to the local appliance parts shop for rightly suggesting  that I check the defrost tube before committing to changing the defrost thermostat.
The good news is that it is all fixed now -- thanks in part to helpful forums like this!

Simple Repairs-
If you're lucky, the temperature setting in your freezer was raised accidentally and the repair is obvious. There are a few other things to check when your freezer runs but fails to cool. Pull the freezer out and look for dust, debris or ice that might be smothering the coils. As chest-style freezers use internal coils, this applies to upright models or refrigerator/freezer combinations. A hair dryer quickly melts ice and a vacuum or soft cloth makes quick work of dust. With the freezer unplugged, locate the motor underneath the freezer and clean it. Defrost the freezer if it's clogged with ice. If you notice water pooling on the floor when the freezer is running but not freezing, check the drain tube in the freezer's floor or underneath the vegetable drawers in the refrigerator compartment. Insert a turkey baster of bleach water into the tube to clean it, or run a length of smaller tubing through it to push out the clog. Also, check for adequate clearance around your freezer and ensure it doesn't sit in a sunny, hot and humid location or in an unheated area.

Frozen refrigerator pipes often indicate a bigger problem with your commercial cooling system. In this article, Cold-Rite offers some DIY ways to thaw your pipes. However, you should always contact a commercial refrigerator repair company to see why your refrigerator pipes are freezing. Fixing the problem now can save you from a costly repair later.
The primary reason why your refrigerator pipes are freezing is that your evaporator coils are too cold. The evaporator is one of the main components of your commercial cooling system. The evaporator coils are filled with a refrigerant solution that cools the air in your industrial coolroom.
When your commercial cooling system is working, the evaporator absorbs heat and expels it. However, several problems with your air conditioning system can cause the evaporator coils to absorb less heat. Rather than condensation turning to a gas through the evaporator, the condensation sits on the coils and freezes. Eventually, this ice build-up can lead to frozen refrigerator pipes.
Now that you know why your refrigerator pipes freeze, let’s go a step further and diagnose the root problem with your commercial cooling system. The ice build-up could be due to:
Before you call your local commercial refrigerator repair team, you can try a few DIY solutions to fix your frozen refrigerator pipes. While the following tips can remedy your problem temporarily, it’s always a good idea to have a trained technician check for problematic system failures too.
Running a defrost cycle will melt all the ice that has accumulated on your pipes already. After you run the cycle, adjust the temperature of your industrial coolroom or freezer to see if a lower temperature will prevent further icing.
Fixing your frozen refrigerator pipes could be as simple as cleaning the air filter or vacuuming the evaporator coils. Dirt restricts airflow and forces your cooling system to work harder than it should.
A blocked or closed vent can prevent cold air from entering and warm air from leaving your industrial coolroom. Opening all of the vents can thaw the frozen evaporator coils.
Some commercial cooling system problems require a professional. If DIY solutions don’t work and you suspect your frozen refrigerator pipes may be the result of a refrigerant leak, blower motor failure or collapsed air duct, you should call Cold-Rite as soon as possible. Waiting for frozen refrigerator pipes to thaw will only result in worse problems for your industrial coolroom.
If your commercial refrigerator is too cold or you notice ice build-up, call Cold-Rite, Sydney’s best refrigerator repair specialists.
In cool rooms and freezers, there are many obvious components that we’ve all had contact with, such as the seals
The evaporator fan in your commercial and industrial refrigeration keeps the air constantly flowing through the unit and across the

A fridge freezing up at the back of the unit is a common problem that many homeowners experience at one point or another.
It’s frustrating, sometimes noisy, and potentially messy, and you’re not sure what to do about it. As repair and maintenance specialists in the UK, these issues …and some fixes you can make yourself are what we’re going to tackle here.
Here’s a quick takeaway answer, and then we’ll go into some further detail on each issue and how to address it.
A fridge may freeze up at the back due to a combination of condensation and poor air circulation around the unit. Other issues include overloading with food, the wrong temperature settings, or faulty parts. Check the temperature, ensure adequate airflow, and if problems persist ask a professional.
Beyond some changes that the user can make, a fridge freezing up at the back can be caused by several other more technical factors, such as an issue with the thermostat setting, issues with the condenser coils, or problems with the defrost timer.
Let’s go through the individual issues and how to deal with them, starting with issues you can tackle yourself.
Fortunately, there are several simple fixes you can try to make yourself to correct the problem. Here are the main simple fixes.
Poor airflow can cause the back of your fridge to freeze, especially if you have it in a tightly enclosed space.
Condensation occurs in most kitchens, sometimes daily. Not only from cooking, but from other appliances such as washing machines and dryers. The placement of these other units (or your fridge) can also be a factor. So where possible, plan your kitchen with these in mind.
Be sure there is plenty of space on all sides of the fridge for air to circulate freely around, on top of, and under the unit where possible.
Modern and built-in fridges are designed to cope better when placed in tighter spaces, but there is still a need for some amount of airflow.
Check the thermostat setting. It should be set at 4 or 5 degrees Celsius. If it is set too low, the fridge may be unable to keep things sufficiently cool and this can also lead to “freezing up.” This also includes the fridge freezing up at the back.
If needed, you can adjust the thermostat setting on your fridge. However, if you’re unsure, or if you’ve tried a few settings without success, then be sure you consult your owner’s manual for detailed instructions on how to do so.
If the problem persists and your fridge continues to freeze up at the back, it may be indicative of a larger issue, such as a faulty thermostat.
It’s important to remember to defrost the fridge regularly, especially if you notice that it is freezing up at the back.
To do this, simply remove all of your food and contents from the fridge, turn off the refrigerator and let any excess ice melt away naturally. Once all of the ice has melted, dry out the inside of your fridge with a soft cloth, turn off any ‘defrost function’ and reset the thermostat to begin cooling your fridge once again.
If you have a manual defrost function, use this to remove any ice build-up.
If your fridge is freezing up at the back and you’ve tackled both the ventilation and the temperature without success, then you may need to have your fridge checked by a professional.
Let’s take a look at the issues that might need to be looked at by a professional. If you’re sure it’s not something you can fix yourself, then you can go straight to calling us to get the help you need.
The first thing you should check is the age of the fridge – or at least the approximate age.
Fridges do have a shelf life, and if your fridge is older than 15 years, or in some cases, 10 years or over, then it might be time to get a new one as the insulation might not be sufficient anymore.
If it’s below this age category, then it might be one (or more) of the technical reasons below.
A fridge that freezes up at the back could have a problem with the compressor. The compressor is what keeps the temperature inside the fridge regulated, so if it’s not working properly, then it will be out of control and may well freeze your fridge. It might find your fridge freezing up at the back, and inside too.
If you think this might be the case, try checking to see if there is any frost on the back panel of your fridge – or even ice. This would indicate that your compressor needs repairing or replacing.
It could be that your fridge has a broken thermostat. This is the device that tells your fridge when to turn the compressor on and off, so if it’s not working properly, then it could be causing your fridge to freeze up at the back – or in many cases everywhere.
The thermostat is most likely the issue if your fridge is freezing food on the lowest setting. It can stick in the “on” position, forcing the compressor to keep on chilling the fridge. A replacement thermostat may be an option, or if the fridge is old, then consider getting a new fridge.
A broken thermostat is often the reason for vegetables freezing in the fridge drawer too, for the same reason, the thermostat is forcing the compressor to continuously work at freezing the compartments. Time for a new thermostat.
If you think the thermostat might be the case, then again, try checking the back panel of your fridge for frost or ice. If there is, then a thermostat replacement could be the solution to your problem.
However, before you make any major repairs or replacements, it may also be worth checking that the fridge’s coils aren’t blocked or dirty. If there is too much dust on them, they won’t operate efficiently and could contribute to your fridge freezing up.
It may be better to call in a professional, but if you can clean them yourself, then make sure you turn off the fridge’s power first so that it doesn’t accidentally come on while you’re trying to clean.
The fan motor is what keeps the air circulating in your fridge to prevent freezing, so if it is faulty or not operating correctly, then it could be another potential cause of your freezer issues.
Another reason your fridge might be freezing up at the back is because of a problem with the defrost function. If the defrost function isn’t working properly, then the ice will build up and eventually cause your fridge to freeze over.
There are a few things you can do to try and fix this issue yourself, such as thawing out your fridge after removing any food that will spoil.
If that doesn’t work, then it’s most likely a faulty defrost function. Time to call in a professional!
Another potential cause of your fridge freezing up could be that the door seals are not airtight, which lets in warm air and causes the fridge to work harder to keep cool.
Check the seals for any gaps or tears and replace them if necessary. If you can’t replace them, then it may be time to consider a new fridge. Or ask a professional to take a look at the issue.
If you have too much food crammed into your fridge, then this could also cause problems as it doesn’t allow enough airflow around the inside of the unit.
Food amounts in fridges can fluctuate – especially after a big shopping trip. This is normal. But a fridge that is constantly overflowing with food will impede airflow, and that could be a major contributory factor to your fridge freezing up.
We hope this has provided you with some simple steps to ascertain if it’s an issue you can fix yourself or one that requires professional help.

Walk-in coolers can occasionally “freeze up.” Depending on the severity of your problem, this can take many forms. On the less-problematic end, you may notice frost buildup on the windows, paneling, and outside packaging of food. On the more-problematic end, you may see large ice crystals, warming temperatures, and damaged products. Regardless of the intensity, no level of freezing up is desirable. Today, let’s better understand why your walk-in cooler may be freezing up.
 Depending on your specific model of a walk-in cooler, there are many reasons why ice could be building up in less-than-ideal locations. That being said, there are a few common things to look out for that may be the main culprit. 
 A walk-in cooler freezing up isn’t just a nuisance – it can damage your unit and reduce its operating lifespan. When significant amounts of ice build-up, damage can occur to many parts of the walk-in.
 First and foremost, the manual that came with your unit will likely have a section on how to look out for and prevent freeze up. It will likely recommend routine check-ups for your unit which is a good first step in preventing build-up.
With that in mind, the primary way to prevent expensive and damaging freezing up is to catch it early! In the beginning stages of ice build-up, you may notice a thin frost layer on many surfaces in the walk-in. This is a good hint that you’ll need to check every one of the locations mentioned above and talk with employees to make sure the door is not being opened for longer than necessary and that product is being stacked away from the evaporator. 
Another great way to minimize humid air infiltration is to install heavy-duty vinyl walk-in curtains. This is especially useful for reducing ice ups in units that open to hot areas, like kitchens.
While a walk-in cooler freezing up can be a hassle, it is also easy to prevent if proper maintenance protocols are followed.

We've all had the misfortune of opening the fridge to find our precious box of blueberries has been frozen. Whether it's fruit, vegetables, meat, or even dairy—accidental frozen food can be disastrous. While you may still be able to eat your perishables (especially if you're cooking them), the expansion of water molecules caused by freezing may completely alter your food.
But before you pull your hair out and curse your fridge manufacturer, there are a number of steps you can take to prevent accidental food freezing from ever happening. Whether it's the top shelf or the crisper drawer, we'll walk you through each precaution for all refrigerator compartments. We can't guarantee you won't have to call a repairman, but at least you'll be able to rule out the other options first.
Check the temperature settings on your fridge. They might be too low.
Before you do anything, check your fridge's temperature settings. Dials aren't an accurate method of regulating temperature, and we've found most digital displays are off by at least a few degrees. 
If the temperature setting is too low, then you'll obviously want to turn it up a bit. Just be careful you don't set it too high. (The ideal set temperature range for the interior of your fridge is 37°F.) The last thing you want is for your food to get too warm and become a haven for bacteria and other opportunistic microbes.
If your fridge is getting old or not that good to begin with, using a separate thermometer may give you a more accurate reading. You can find cheap analog thermometers or fancier digital wireless versions that allow you to monitor the temperature without even opening the door. 
You can prevent most fridge mishaps by keeping a thermometer handy.
Refrigerators don't have a uniform temperature inside. Check the user manual for instructions on where to put meat, cheese, dairy, etc.
If your food is still freezing even after turning up the temperature settings, try to determine the area of the fridge where it's occurring. According to GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge (crisper drawers and meat pans), and door shelves.
As long as it's confined to one area, it should be pretty simple to remedy. All you have to do is keep your most temperature-sensitive foods out of that area. However, if the fridge cavity overall is still too cold, there may be a more serious issue at hand.


            Enter your email:
          


Once you've determined the problem area, check to see if it's near a vent. Most fridges have a cooling vent above or on the side of the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. (A five-inch radius should do the trick.)
If the problem area is a door shelf, you may want to adjust its position. Some side-by-side refrigerators (particularly older models) feature a vent that funnels cold air from the freezer into the fridge. This outlet is usually located on the wall that separates the fridge and freezer, and will likely blow freezing cold air all over everything around it. Relocate the shelves to avoid this cold air.
If you have a bottom-freezer model and you notice that the problem area is around the bottom of the fridge compartment, then it is almost certainly due to air venting from the freezer. However, it may also be due to a simple lack of food in the fridge! (More on that below.)
Remember from science class that heat rises, so the bottom section of the fridge is probably going to be the coldest.
So you've moved your food away from the vents but it's still freezing? The problem might still be the freezer. As mentioned, there are a lot of factors at play, one of which is your machine's freezer-orientation, and a bottom-freezer fridge may be particularly troubling. Remember from science class that heat rises, so the bottom section of the fridge is probably going to be the coldest.
One solution is to slightly turn up your freezer temperature settings, although you should be careful not to raise it too high. Anything north of 0°F will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage—yes, even in a freezer!
Another option is to make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could also make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.
A mostly empty fridge isn't just sad—it makes the internal temperature less stable.
This may seem like a dumb solution, but it's actually valid. GE explains how if the food at the bottom of your fridge keeps freezing, it could simply be because your fridge isn't fully packed.
Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. So just keep it filled! 
As an added bonus, a fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures—especially in the freezer—and, as a result, use less energy, which is great news for your utility bill.
If you've done all of the above and your food is still freezing, then there is most likely a mechanical issue that will require a refrigerator repair. From the thermostat to the damper to the control panel, there are a lot of parts that may be malfunctioning.
Your best bet is to check if your fridge is still under warranty and to contact either the manufacturer or the retailer that sold it to you. They can send out a service representative to determine what's wrong with the fridge. If it's no longer under warranty, you'll need to contact your local appliance repairman.
