Ovens with Air Fry Mode cook wings, nuggets and more right in your oven using less oil than traditional frying.
A range with a single oven offers simple meal management with limited spatial restrictions. At Whirlpool, our single oven ranges are available in slide-in or freestanding designs. Freestanding single ovens are a great option for quick appliance replacements as they can be installed with greater flexibility in any layout, while slide-in ranges provide a more built-in appearance perfect for custom designs. Our single freestanding ovens let you cook and bake your favorites with features like guided cooktop controls for more accurate heating, Frozen Bake™ technology to eliminate preheating and self-cleaning options to make everyday maintenance a snap. Browse Whirlpool® freestanding ranges with a single oven to find the best model for your kitchen. Explore our range sales for current deals and savings on Whirlpool® ranges. Need more room to cook? Whirlpool also offers double oven ranges to ensure you have the capacity to prepare your family’s meals.
How to properly clean and maintain your range depends on the model and design. To clean a glass electric stovetop, wait for the surface to cool completely then wipe up spills and smudges with a clean, damp cloth. Dry with a clean, dry cloth. For cooktops with gas burners and grates, wait for the grates to cool completely and then remove them from the cooktop. Clean your gas cooktop by soaking the grates in hot soapy water for 20 minutes while you wipe the stove’s surface with a clean, damp cloth.

Ovens with Air Fry Mode cook wings, nuggets and more right in your oven using less oil than traditional frying.
A range with a single oven offers simple meal management with limited spatial restrictions. At Whirlpool, our single oven ranges are available in slide-in or freestanding designs. Freestanding single ovens are a great option for quick appliance replacements as they can be installed with greater flexibility in any layout, while slide-in ranges provide a more built-in appearance perfect for custom designs. Our single freestanding ovens let you cook and bake your favorites with features like guided cooktop controls for more accurate heating, Frozen Bake™ technology to eliminate preheating and self-cleaning options to make everyday maintenance a snap. Browse Whirlpool® freestanding ranges with a single oven to find the best model for your kitchen. Explore our range sales for current deals and savings on Whirlpool® ranges. Need more room to cook? Whirlpool also offers double oven ranges to ensure you have the capacity to prepare your family’s meals.
How to properly clean and maintain your range depends on the model and design. To clean a glass electric stovetop, wait for the surface to cool completely then wipe up spills and smudges with a clean, damp cloth. Dry with a clean, dry cloth. For cooktops with gas burners and grates, wait for the grates to cool completely and then remove them from the cooktop. Clean your gas cooktop by soaking the grates in hot soapy water for 20 minutes while you wipe the stove’s surface with a clean, damp cloth.

The differences between the types of ranges lie in the installation and the location of controls. While slide-in ranges are designed to fit between cabinets, freestanding models allow you to configure your kitchen how you like through the choice of built-in or stand-alone placement.
Freestanding ranges are built with a backguard that houses the controls. On slide-in ranges, which do not feature a backguard, range controls are displayed prominently at the front of the appliance.
If you’re looking for the perfect appliance for fueling your busy kitchen, it’s important to know where the key differences between slide-in and freestanding ranges lie.
A freestanding range is an incredibly versatile model that can be easily incorporated into most kitchen layouts. With a cooktop surface and one or two ovens below, these ranges can come in gas, electric or dual fuel options, with a control panel for both the cooktop and oven.
When you think of a typical range, this is the model you probably envision. Freestanding ranges feature finished sides that allow them to be installed between cabinets or on their own, making them a flexible choice for most kitchens. In addition to housing the controls, backguards on these ranges also help protect the wall behind the range from spills and splashes. However, the protruding backguard also means that freestanding ranges may not be the best fit for kitchen islands. Bring convenience and personalization to your kitchen layout with a Whirlpool® freestanding range.

A slide-in range is a model designed to slide between kitchen cabinets, appliances or other fixtures to provide a seamless, built-in look. Featuring an array of cooking controls prominently displayed at the front of the appliance, these models are a practical choice for spaces with kitchen islands or decorative backsplash walls. Slide-in ranges are also available in several fuel options, including electric, gas and dual fuel.
The main difference between freestanding and slide-in ranges is installation. While freestanding ranges can stand alone or be installed between cabinets, one of the benefits of slide-in ranges is that they are specifically designed to sit between cabinets for a seamless look. Because of this, slide-in ranges have unfinished sides that makes them ill-suited for standalone installation.

The configuration is also different – controls for slide-in ranges are usually located on the top or front of the appliance. Slide-in ranges also lack a backguard, which is why many homeowners install tile behind the range if they are placing it against a wall.

The sleek look of slide-in ranges has made them popular choices for kitchen remodels and installation in kitchen islands.

 A drop-in range is a cooking appliance that fits into customized cabinetry and is most commonly installed in kitchen islands. These ranges tend to sit above woodwork or cabinetry to give the appliance a built-in look. 
It provides a streamlined and seamless look for your kitchen, with the control panel often found on the front of the range rather than on a backguard. Drop-in ranges tend to be more expensive than other types of ranges due to their customization and installation costs.
There are several factors that differentiate slide-in ovens from freestanding and drop-in options, including installation, control configuration and features. Read on below to better understand these key differences to help make your choice a little easier.
Freestanding ranges are highly flexible when it comes to installation. They can be installed nearly anywhere in your kitchen, and typically don’t require any customization or cabinetry. Slide-in and drop-in ovens are typically more expensive than freestanding options as they can have more costly installations that may require professional help and need to be installed within existing or custom cabinetry.
Freestanding ranges typically have the oven controls, timers and settings on the backguard, while slide-in and drop-in ovens usually have them located on the front of the range. Because they don’t have a backguard, drop-in and slide-in ranges are ideal to install in kitchen islands or beneath decorative backsplash.
Specific range features vary depending on the make and model of your range. However, a feature that many slide-in and freestanding ranges share that a drop-in often lacks is a storage/warming drawer. This can be convenient for storing pots, pans, and food items that you plan to cook. Drop-in range designs often omit this drawer to help the appliance fit more seamlessly within custom cabinets or kitchen islands. 
While both freestanding and slide-in ranges offer similar options and performance, the two designs are not completely interchangeable. Once again, it comes down to installation.
Slide-in ranges are not installed directly against a wall, sitting a few inches away from it. Because of this, there is usually a few inches of countertop space that wraps around the back of the cooktop. If you swap out your slide-in range for a freestanding model, you will need to update your countertop configuration to accommodate it.
Likewise, you’ll need to prepare to fill in a two-inch gap (or larger) if you’re trading in a freestanding range for a slide-in model. You’ll also need to update the wall behind your range so it’s immune to steam, water and stains.
Before purchasing a freestanding or slide-in range, be sure to speak with a qualified appliance retailer and/or a remodeling expert to make sure your new range will fit properly in your kitchen.
To help you decide on the best range model for your kitchen, learn more about range sizes and dimensions.
When trying to decide between a slide-in, drop-in or freestanding range, it’s important to consider kitchen layout, fuel source, aesthetics and your family’s needs.
Where will the new range go? Will it need gas or electric hook-ups? Do you want your range to blend in or stand out? Will the new range be able to accommodate your family’s favorite dishes? 
Before you make your purchase, be sure that your new range is the right fit in every way.
While slide-in ranges are often more expensive due to the custom nature of their installation, the best type of range for your home will depend on the layout and look you’re trying to achieve for your kitchen.

Poached pears, steamed mussels, and broiled flounder find their way to your table via one important kitchen appliance—the range. With an oven and cooktop combined into one versatile appliance, a kitchen range is often at the center of your culinary explorations. But what kind of range is best for your kitchen setup? Read on to learn more about the difference between a slide-in range and a freestanding range, and get help choosing the best type of range or stove for you.
The primary differences between freestanding and slide-in ranges are the installation and the location of the controls. Freestanding ranges can be installed between cabinets for a built in look or can act as a stand-alone appliance, while slide-in ranges are designed to fit within your kitchen cabinets. Freestanding ranges feature a backguard that doubles as a control panel, with gas burner controls located on the front. Slide-in ranges do not have a backguard and all controls are located on the front. You can find both types of stoves in gas, electric and dual-fuel options with a wide selection of features and functions.
Slide-in ranges are designed to slide between cabinets or other appliances to provide seamless integration with custom cabinetry, much like these ranges from KitchenAid brand that come in both electric, gas and dual-fuel options. Since slide-in ranges do not have backsplash panels, they are ideal for installation in kitchen islands or against a wall that features a continuous backsplash. However, since many of today’s slide-in ranges feature finished sides, you can now install one virtually anywhere in your kitchen.
Here are some advantages to choosing a slide-in range:
Integrated installation: The lack of backguard on slide-in stoves helps you achieve a built-in look when installed between cabinets or other appliances. If you have a decorative backsplash on the wall behind your installation location, there is no backguard to block this design feature.
Helps maintain an open layout: Slide-in ranges are ideal for kitchen islands because there is no backguard to protrude above your countertop surface. All controls are on the front of the appliance to keep settings at your fingertips and create a seamless flow from countertop to cooking surface.
Downdraft ventilation: If a traditional range hood will get in the way of your creative flow, opt for a slide-in range with a downdraft ventilation system built right into the cooktop. A downdraft range eliminates the need for an additional ventilation appliance. If you want a streamlined look, this style range helps you cook, bake, and vent all at once.

Freestanding ranges also come in both gas and electric options and feature a built-in backsplash, like these gas and electric freestanding ranges from KitchenAid®. The backsplash makes these ranges versatile and easy to incorporate into a new or pre-existing kitchen layout. With this integrated backguard and finished sides, they can be installed standing alone, between cabinets, or at the edge of the counter with one side exposed.
Here are some advantages to choosing a freestanding range:
Integrated Backguard: If you need a built-in way to protect the wall behind the range from grease, smoke and splatters, many freestanding models are designed with a backguard that also houses the controls.
Flexible Installation: If your range will stand alone, or if you anticipate changing your kitchen layout over the lifetime of the range, a freestanding model can provide extra flexibility to make sure you always have a cohesive kitchen design. While you can also install a slide-in range standing on its own, a freestanding range eliminates the need for a separate backsplash. Note that while freestanding ranges have finished sides, the color may vary from the rest of the appliance. For example some stainless steel freestanding ranges feature sides with a black finish. 
Lower entry price-point: While the price of stoves varies widely based on features, materials, size and other considerations, freestanding ranges tend to offer a lower entry price-point for consumers on a budget.

Freestanding and slide-in range designs are not entirely interchangeable due to their difference in installation. Because slide-in ranges are not installed directly against a wall, a few inches of countertop space are typically added to fill the gap between the back of the appliance and the wall. If you swap out your slide-in range for a freestanding option, you will need to update your kitchen layout to install the range properly.
From the sleek and contemporary look of a slide-in downdraft range, to the premium, feature-rich commercial-style lineup, KitchenAid has ranges to fuel endless exploration. Create a kitchen that inspires discovery every time you step into it with ranges that express your style and capture your tastes.
