Cooktops are a versatile and increasingly popular kitchen appliance, offering flexibility and style to any cooking space. Unlike traditional ranges, cooktops are installed directly into the countertop, providing a seamless and streamlined look that appeals to modern design sensibilities. This installation style also frees up under-counter space for storage or aesthetic purposes. Cooktops come in various types, including gas, electric, and induction, each offering unique benefits to suit different cooking preferences and styles. Gas cooktops provide quick and precise temperature control, electric cooktops offer even heating and ease of cleaning, and induction cooktops excel in energy efficiency and safety.
 
Flexibility in design is another key advantage of cooktops. They are available in a range of sizes and burner configurations, allowing for customization based on cooking needs and kitchen layout. High-end models may include features such as specialized burners for wok cooking, integrated griddles, or touch controls for a sleek, button-free surface. The variety in styles, from stainless steel to glass-ceramic, allows cooktops to fit into any kitchen décor, from classic to contemporary. Their ease of cleaning, particularly in models with smooth surfaces, makes them a practical choice for busy households.
Selecting the right cooktop involves considering your cooking habits, kitchen design, and preferred energy source. Measure your countertop space to determine the appropriate size and layout for the cooktop. Think about the type of cooking you do most often and select a model with the features that will best accommodate your needs, such as extra burners, specific burner types, or advanced temperature controls. Also, consider the aesthetic appeal of the cooktop and how it will integrate into your kitchen’s design.
 
Installation of a cooktop is a task that should be undertaken by professionals, especially as it may involve adjustments to your countertop and connections to gas or electrical systems. Coast Appliances offers expert installation services to ensure your new cooktop is installed safely and efficiently. Professional installation guarantees that your cooktop is set up correctly, adhering to safety standards and optimizing its performance. Once installed, regular maintenance is key. Keeping the cooktop clean and ensuring all connections (gas or electrical) are secure will prolong the life of your appliance and ensure it remains a reliable and efficient part of your kitchen. 
For more detailed information on our delivery, installation, and haul-away services, please visit our shipping and delivery page.
Cooktops fall into three categories. Gas cooktops use propane or natural gas to create a flame. Electric cooktops have a metal coil heated by electricity, usually sealed under a sheet of glass for easier cleanup. Induction cooktops look like electrics, but instead of a hot coil, they use a magnetic field to heat the cookware itself rather than the cooktop. Keep in mind that induction cooktops require induction cookware.
Cooktops are measured as a square: width and depth. Unlike a TV or computer screen that is measured on the diagonal, cooktops are measured straight across. Two standard widths are 30" and 36", but many others are available.
Since every cooktop requires hooking up either electricity or gas lines - or both - installing one is a job best left to licensed professionals. Expert installation services from Coast Appliances mean you never have to worry about installing a cooktop yourself.
A stove is simply an appliance for cooking or heating, including everything from a pellet stove to a gas oven. A kitchen "stove" is often used interchangeably with "range,” which is a combination cooktop and oven, while a cooktop comes as its own unit without an oven.
The best brands of cooktops are the one that fits your style and cooking needs. At Coast Appliances, we carry a full range of cooktops from reliable manufacturers including Dacor, Samsung, Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Wolf and more.
Since 1978, Coast Appliances has been supplying Canadians with the brands they want and the expertise they need.

Cooktops are standalone appliances featuring a cooking surface with burners or elements, but no oven. Cooktops provide kitchen layout flexibility since they install directly into countertops, can be placed on an island, and are available in gas, electric, induction and downdraft models in a wide range of sizes. Whether you’re building, remodeling or replacing, use this guide to learn why you might want a cooktop vs. a range and what the best type of cooktop might be for your family.
A cooktop is a standalone cooking appliance that utilizes multiple burners or heating elements to heat up the surface so that you are able to cook your food. Cooktops can be installed into countertops or they can stand alone on flat surfaces such as kitchen islands.
Whirlpool® Cooktops offer flexible cooking capabilities and easy cleaning so you can get your family’s dinner on the table with ease.
Choosing a cooktop vs. a range separates stovetop and oven tasks while creating a streamlined, built-in look. Great for larger kitchens, this configuration spreads out mealtime action in a way that could help you manage the mess and keep meals moving without a lot of bending or squatting. Cooktops can also be a good option for kitchens with limited counter space, since they’re available in narrower sizes than most ranges. For example, Whirlpool brand offers a 15-inch Electric Cooktop for compact kitchens.
There are four types of cooktops: gas, electric, induction and downdraft. Each option has features and benefits that you may want to consider when choosing a new cooktop for your kitchen. Read on to learn more about different types of cooktops.
This type of cooktop uses an open flame to heat cookware. Gas cooktops offer responsive control over heat adjustments, making them ideal when making quick adjustments for delicate dishes as well as everyday meals. The flame can be adjusted instantly, so you don’t need to wait for an electric element to heat up or cool down. Gas heat is measured in BTUs (British Thermal Unit), with some burners offering higher heat, and often a larger flame than others for different cooking tasks. This Whirlpool® Gas Cooktops with a SpeedHeat™ Burner can quickly generate high heat to help dinner get on the table fast. Gas cooktops usually feature removable grates, with some models offering a hinged design like the EZ-2-Lift™ Hinged Cast-Iron Grates by Whirlpool brand, which are also dishwasher-safe.

Electric cooktops heat cookware using metal coils or heating elements that may be exposed or sometimes hidden under a flat ceramic-glass surface that makes wiping up spills simple. Many models offer elements whose size can be adjusted to smaller or larger cookware for added flexibility like the Dual Radiant Element by Whirlpool brand. Accommodate extra-large dishes with “bridge” elements that heat the space between the front and back elements and can be found on select electric cooktops.

An induction cooktop is a type of electric cooktop that uses electromagnetism to turn cookware into its own heat source. Induction technology transfers energy directly into magnetic cookware for fast cooking. The system allows for a rapid rise or drop in temperature and, because the cooking surface stays relatively cool, spills are less likely to bake onto it. Keep in mind that you can’t use aluminum or copper cookware on an induction cooktop unless it features a magnetic core. Learn more about induction cooking, induction cooktops vs electric cooktops, or check out our guide on the best induction cooktops.

A downdraft cooktop integrates the ventilation system directly into the cooking surface, eliminating the need for an overhead vent. They’re a good option if you’re installing your cooktop on a kitchen island where there isn’t room for a hood, or if you just like an open feel to your kitchen. Keep in mind that you’ll need under-counter cabinet space to house the ventilation system. 
Downdraft cooktops can come in gas, like this 5-burner option from KitchenAid brand, electric or induction styles.
Combines ventilation with cooking in one appliance
Can be installed in kitchens with open floor plans or kitchens without range hood capacity
A commercial-style cooktop is an upscale option for those looking to upgrade their kitchen with a restaurant-style look. These cooktops come in various sizes, ranging from the extra-wide 60 inch size, all the way down to more standard sizes. Some models  come equipped with features like high-BTU gas burners and grill or griddle inserts, perfect for cooking up a wide variety of meals. Commercial-style cooktops typically come in stainless steel or colorful finishes to align with any other commercial-style appliances in your kitchen.
High-BTU gas burners for powerful cooking performance on select models
Larger size options, with some models as wide as 60 inches wide
Sleek design that adds style and sophistication to any space
There are a few factors to consider when choosing a new cooktop for your kitchen. Explore the following shopping tips below to help you get started on your shopping journey.
Don't forget that you'll need some type of vent near your cooktop. A ventilation system is essential to help clear kitchen air of smoke, odor and grease while you cook. If you're placing the cooktop on a kitchen island, look at island-canopy hoods. If you're installing in-line with cabinets, a wall-mounted canopy hood or over-the-range microwave hood combination might be right for you. Learn more in our guide to choosing the right ventilation for your kitchen.
Each type of cooktop comes with its own unique installation needs that you should take into account when choosing a new model for your kitchen. For example, gas cooktops require access to a gas line, while electric cooktops do not.  
You should also consider the surface you're planning to install the cooktop on. If you're installing a cooktop on a kitchen island, you may want to pair your cooktop with a retractable downdraft hood to avoid an over-the-range hood.
Gas, electric and induction cooktops all have different cooking surfaces that require varying maintenance and cleaning methods. To clean gas cooktops, you need to remove and clean the grates in addition to the cooking surface. Induction cooktops – and some electric cooktops – have smooth glass surfaces that make it easy to clean once mealtime is over.
Select Whirlpool® Gas Cooktops may also feature EZ-2-Lift™ Hinged Cast-Iron Grates that give you quick access to cooktop spills and can be easily added to the dishwasher when it’s time to clean.
When shopping for a new cooktop, look for features that best fit your cooking needs. Select Whirlpool® Gas Cooktops offer features like the SpeedHeat™ Burner that helps you sear and boil quickly by generating high heat and a 2-in-1 Hinged Grate to Griddle that lets you explore more mealtime possibilities by allowing you to swap between cooking surfaces.
Induction and glass electric stovetops are typically the easiest to wipe clean as there are no removable parts that need additional attention during the cleaning process. All you’ll usually need to clean these kinds of cooktops is a cook surface cleaning solution, non-abrasive cleaning pads and a soft dry cloth to wipe away spills and food debris.
Select Whirlpool® Gas Cooktops have features that make cleaning simple, like EZ-2-Lift™ Hinged Cast-Iron Grates that let you wipe spills on the cooktop without the hassle of removing heavy grates.
Scratch-resistance varies by the make and model of your cooktop. Some gas, induction and electric models offer scratch-resistant surfaces, so be sure to consult the product description when shopping for a new cooktop.

Whether you choose gas, electric, induction or downdraft, Whirlpool brand offers cooktops to fit nearly any kitchen. Whirlpool® Cooktops are easy to use and designed with thoughtful innovations to streamline meal prep, so you can trust that your stovetop will help you create your family’s favorite meals every night.

Investing in a new standalone cooktop can offer fresh inspiration and unlock new culinary possibilities. Explore the benefits of gas, electric, induction, downdraft and commercial-style options to find a cooktop style that complements the way you create.
A cooktop is a standalone appliance with a cooking surface that has gas burners or electric heating elements. The cooktop controls are on the front surface or along the side of the appliance. Its drop-in installation in a hole or space in a countertop or island can provide a seamless integration with your kitchen. 
Whether you need to simmer, steam, grill or boil, a cooktop offers a variety of innovative features to match your cooking technique. Similar to a rangetop, a cooktop can upgrade your kitchen design by adding flexibility to the layout. 
There are several types of cooktop fuel options to choose from, including gas, electric and induction models. These types may also come in downdraft configurations for integrated ventilation and commercial-style options for more features. Cooktops are also available in a range of sizes with different heating element configurations.
Gas cooktops use an open flame to cook food. They’re great for a more hands-on experience since they offer responsive control over heat adjustments. The flame can be adjusted instantly, so you don’t need to wait for a heating element to heat up or cool down, allowing you to quickly transition from searing to sautéing. An open flame is also able to reach up the sides of some pans, which can be a benefit when cooking with sculpted cookware, such as woks. Most models, like the full line of gas cooktops from KitchenAid brand, feature removable cast-iron grates with a wipeable surface underneath.

Electric cooktops cook food using heated metal coils or heating elements often housed in a flat, smooth ceramic-glass surface. Select KitchenAid® models include Ultra Power™ Double-Ring Round Element that allows you to adjust the heating element size to fit cookware from hearty stock pots to petite sauté pans. Electric cooktops with Even-Heat™ Technology provide versatility for high and low temperature cooking preferences and ensure consistent heat when boiling, simmering, melting and more. If you’re looking for a compact cooktop, electric models often come in a wide range of sizes. For instance, KitchenAid® electric cooktops come in two-burner, four-burner, five-burner and downdraft configurations.

Induction cooktops generate heat directly within cookware, reaching high temperatures quickly and cooling down rapidly for precise control that enables a full range of cooking techniques. If you cook a lot of pasta or rice, they’re good for getting to a boil quickly since they effectively direct energy to the bottom of the pot. Many induction cooktop models, like the KitchenAid® Architect Series II Cooktop, come with a smooth ceramic-glass surface that allows for quick cleanup. Learn more about how to clean different types of stovetops.

Downdraft cooktops are available as gas or electric models. They integrate the ventilation system directly into the cooking surface, minimizing the need for an overhead vent. They may be a good option if you’re installing your cooktop on a kitchen island where there isn’t room for a hood, or if you prefer an open feel to your kitchen. Electric and gas downdraft cooktops from KitchenAid brand come in four-burner and five-burner configurations. Keep in mind that you’ll need under-counter cabinet space to house internal components essential to the operation of a downdraft cooktop.

Commercial-style rangetops and cooktops deliver restaurant-inspired form and function. They pair commercial styling with features like high-BTU gas burners and grill or griddle inserts to help keep up with your culinary potential. Commercial-style cooktops come in extra-wide sizes up to 60 inches, as well as more standard sizes, like the KitchenAid® 30-inch Smart Commercial-Style Dual Fuel Range with 4 Burners.

To choose the best cooktop for your recipes and kitchen layout, you will need to determine the cooktop size, fuel type and placement that fits best in your kitchen, as well as any features you would like to have. Explore this cooktop buying guide to learn more about getting the best cooktop for your kitchen.
Start by choosing between gas or electric based on the hookups you already have, keeping in mind that you can have a dedicated gas line installed by a professional. Then, look at your kitchen layout and available space. 
Cooktops come in a range of sizes to fit your kitchen and cooking style. Sizes range from 15 inches wide for a two-element cooktop up to 36 inches wide for a five-element cooktop. 
If you’re looking for even more space to create, commercial-style cooktops can offer 30- to 48-inch widths, and even 60-inch widths are available from some manufacturers.
Cooktops can be placed in line with cabinets or on a kitchen island, depending on how you prefer to move throughout the kitchen. Learn more about the benefits of installing a cooktop or range on a kitchen island.
Whether you seek more control over the heating elements or gas burners, desire the convenience of a cooktop griddle, or are considering an upgrade to a restaurant-inspired design, understanding cooktop features can help ensure that you select one that matches your cooking style and preferences.
Some gas cooktops feature a removable griddle that can expand the potential of your cooktop. For example, this KitchenAid® Gas Cooktop with Griddle provides a one-piece flat surface that can be used on the right, left, or center of the cooktop. It is ideal for making a range of dishes from crepes to quesadillas and features an easy cleanup. Learn more about using a griddle on a gas stove.
Many electric cooktops offer elements you can adjust according to the size of your cookware. The 10-inch/6-inch Double-Ring Round Element by KitchenAid brand maximizes your cooking flexibility with two distinct sizes.
Often seen on commercial-style cooktops, convertible grates let you raise and lower your dishes to be closer or farther from the flame. Three-Level Convertible Grates by KitchenAid brand let you match the heat to your technique. Leave the insert level for high-heat searing and sautéing or flip it over to lift your pan above the flame to simmer and melt. It can also be removed to nestle a round-bottom wok in the flame for stir-frying.
Gas, electric and induction cooktops may have their own version of a protective, easy-to-clean surface finish. For instance, the CookShield Finish by KitchenAid brand helps protect electric glass cooktops from scratching and stainless steel gas cooktops from stains that may occur with high-temperature cooking. Learn more about how to clean stainless steel cooktops.
If you're looking for restaurant-inspired design, consider upgrading to a commercial-style cooktop. Select models offer premium features like high-heat burners with up to 20,000 BTUs, electric griddles and extra burners. Commercial-styling—like large knobs and stainless steel details—add pro-style durability.

Some home chefs say that induction cooktops and ranges are the wave of the future, offering a safer and more energy-efficient way of cooking. An induction cooktop is a special type of electric cooktop. It generates energy from an electromagnetic field below the glass cooktop surface, which then transfers current directly to magnetic cookware, causing it to heat up.
Induction cooktops and induction ranges generally outperform every other kind in Consumer Reports’ tests. In fact, every induction cooktop and induction range tested through our range lab delivers fast cooktop heat and superb simmering. What’s more, if you buy a new induction cooktop or range, you may be eligible for financial incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Induction cooktops and ranges look and function a lot like typical glass-top electric models, except that they cook via a magnetic field. On most 30-inch induction cooktops, the field is concentrated into four spots (or elements).
As for the ovens in induction ranges, they broil and bake just as other electric ovens do, but their capabilities differ from model to model. High-end options might have features like convection, WiFi connectivity, and even in-oven cameras so that you can monitor whatever you’re baking with a smartphone. Entry-level options will have many of the same features you’d find on regular electrics, like storage or warming drawers, adjustable racks, and a self-cleaning mode. 
To learn more about induction, see our cooktop and range buying guides. Our ratings of induction cooktops and ranges highlight each appliance’s performance and specifications.
There are plenty of things to love about induction ranges, whether you’re obsessed with perfectly prepped food or interested in energy efficiency. Here’s how they compare with gas and conventional electric ranges.
They’re more environmentally friendly. Induction stoves are up to 10 percent more energy-efficient than conventional electric smooth-top stoves and about three times more efficient than gas stoves. And compared with gas, they’re better for indoor air quality.
They have a built-in safety feature. If you turn on an induction burner with no pot on it by mistake, it won’t get hot. That’s because the heat is created from within the cookware itself; as soon as you remove it from a burner, that heating stops. So the glass surface never gets as hot as it would on a traditional radiant electric range, and you’re not at risk of burning yourself if you touch it. That surface might merely feel hot in the way a kitchen counter feels hot if you put a pot of just-cooked soup on it.
Food cooks faster. No other cooking technology we’ve tested is speedier than induction. It cuts out the intermediate step of heating up an element and then transferring the heat to the pot. Compared with electric or gas, it cooks more quickly when you turn up the heat and responds faster when you dial it back down. You’ll find that 6 quarts of water will approach a boil 2 to 4 minutes sooner than on a gas or electric stove, which can definitely be helpful when you’re making dinner on a busy weeknight.
Cooking is easier. With heat generating from within your pot or pan, induction ranges cook more precisely and evenly. That means no more simmering sauces that break into a splattering boil or chicken thighs that emerge from the pan scorched.
They’re easier to clean. Like other smoothtop electrics, induction surfaces are easy to wipe down.
When it comes to our tests, induction ranges are tough to beat. See ratings and reviews at CR.org/ranges. #kitchentok #kitchentiktok #cooktop 
Before you shop for an induction cooktop or range, consider your budget and your cooking habits. Here’s what you need to know.
Induction cooking feels very different from cooking with gas. Some avid cooks really love cooking on a flame and the immediate visual feedback they get from it at the turn of a knob. No electric option, even induction, can replicate that feel. In fact, because the electromagnetic field on an induction cooktop doesn’t create a glow, you won’t even know it’s on. That’s why manufacturers have started adding virtual flames and other lighting cues.
It can get expensive when you convert from gas to electric. If you’re replacing an electric range, the swap is simple. Induction cooktops and ranges use the same outlet as a standard electric range or cooktop. But if you’re switching from gas, expect to pay an electrician several hundred dollars or more to install the necessary outlet.
You need the right cookware. While most of the cookware in our ratings is induction-compatible, some pans—including those made of aluminum and anodized aluminum—won’t work on induction. Most others, including stainless steel and cast iron, will. If you’re shopping for cookware for induction cooktops, look for pots and pans marked “induction-compatible.” To determine whether your existing arsenal of cookware will work with an induction range, see whether a magnet strongly sticks to the bottom of your pots. If it does, they’ll work on an induction burner.
It might emit a sound. “A buzz or hum is common, and often louder at higher settings,” says Tara Casaregola, who oversees the testing of ranges and cooktops at Consumer Reports. “And we often hear the clicking of element electronics at lower settings, as well as the sound of the cooling fan for the electronics.” Heavy flat-bottomed pans help reduce the vibrations that cause this buzz.
You may need an analog thermometer. The magnetic field of an induction cooktop can interfere with a digital meat thermometer.
Induction cooktops and ranges are typically more expensive than conventional electric models. But prices have continued to drop in recent years despite inflation, with a recommended induction range in our ratings selling for about $1,200. And buying a new induction cooktop or range may make you eligible for rebates because of the Inflation Reduction Act.
To learn more about induction, see our cooktop and range buying guides. CR members can also browse our full list of ratings for induction cooktops and ranges. Here, we’ve highlighted two of the best induction ranges in our ratings, as well as the best 30-inch and 36-inch induction cooktops.
An induction range is best for kitchens with limited space because it packs a cooktop and oven into a single appliance. Here are two standout models from our ratings.
If you have the space, a cooktop (along with a wall oven that you buy separately) can be a nice way to break up cooking areas in your kitchen. The two cooktops below are exceptional performers from our tests.
