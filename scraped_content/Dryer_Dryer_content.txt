When purchasing a new dryer, you’ll first have to choose between a gas or an electric dryer. These types of dryers work differently. Gas dryers require a gas hookup, using natural gas or propane to generate heat and generally cost less over time due to lower electricity consumption. Electric dryers are powered entirely by electricity, using metal heating coils to generate heat. They have a quick installation and are generally less expensive to purchase. There are many benefits to both gas and electric dryers. To decide which Maytag® dryer is right for you, read more on the differences between gas and electric dryers or explore the option of large capacity dryers.
After deciding between an electric or a gas dryer, you’ll want to choose a finish that works for you and your laundry room. Maytag brand offers dryers in Heritage White, Metallic Slate and White finishes. No matter what finish you choose, your Maytag® dryer is sure to perform well while looking great.

We are in love with our new Samsung dryer, works perfect, very easy to use and SmartThings makes our life so much easier, excellent appliance
The best thing about this dryer is the capacity in my opinion, it is HUGE! No more having to wash your comforters and duvets at a laundry mat. 
I'm so happy I got this dryer, it's super quiet, with huge capacity and convenient 4-way venting. I love the smart things app features, I can control the dryer from my phone.
This unit also has an AI assistant built in that will help optimize your dry cycle. It will also communicate with your washer to let it know what the best drying cycle is for the load! 
This thing drys incredibly fast and doesn't overheat your clothes. There are lots of options for types of drying and the ability to refresh items via steam cleaning. 
I honestly never thought I would say that I look forward to doing laundry...I mean I can't even begin to tell you how much I actually love using this machine.
This machine does it all! I put my clothing in the machine and select my cycle. After the wash cycle there is no need to swap from one machine to the next. The drying cycle automatically begins. 
I have had this dryer for a six months, it runs great, would buy it again.
Great dryer. I love all the different options the dryer has and the high-tech functionality the Wi-Fi connectivity brings. I have used a few options and they all perform excellently and leave the clothes dry.
See how others are using their washers and dryers to give their home a design boost in the laundry department.
