A kitchen range, also called a stove, brings together an oven and a stovetop/cooktop to keep up with all your cooking tasks from sautéing to baking. Ranges come in a variety of styles, sizes and fuel types to complement different cooking routines and kitchen aesthetics.
Over time, different terminology arose to refer to this classic cooking appliance, but a range and a stove are essentially the same thing when talking about modern kitchen appliances and these words can be used interchangeably. Learn more about the difference between a range vs stove vs oven and decide what’s right for your kitchen.
Within the kitchen range category, you have some choices regarding style, fuel type and features.
Freestanding ranges are designed to either stand alone or install between cabinets, while slide-in ranges are built to slide between cabinets or be integrated with kitchen islands for a more built-in look. The most noticeable difference between the two is the presence of a backguard on freestanding ranges where the oven controls are located. Slide-in ranges don’t have a backguard and instead place the controls on the front of the range. Learn more about these distinct styles in the slide-in vs freestanding range guide.
Kitchen ranges come in a variety of fuel types. Selecting a fuel type will depend on the cooking experience you prefer and your kitchen layout. Read more about the different fuel types below to help you decide which will work best for you.
Gas ranges have gas heat on the stovetop and inside the oven. They cook food with an open flame and require a dedicated natural gas or propane line. Gas heat is known for its responsiveness: the flame can be adjusted instantly, allowing you to quickly move between heat levels. An open flame can also be used to flame-grill, char and flambé right on the stovetop.












Electric ranges feature electric heat on the stovetop and inside the oven. On the stovetop, heat is typically generated through metal coils, often housed in an easy-to-clean, flat glass surface. Inside the oven, heating elements are generally known to provide dry, consistent heat excellent for roasting and broiling. Learn more about electric vs. gas ranges.












Induction ranges are technically electric ranges since they use electric power, but the stovetop heats differently. Induction stovetops generate electromagnetic energy that interacts directly with compatible cookware, turning pots and pans into their own heat source. These ranges are known for exceptional temperature control and ease of cleaning. Learn more about induction cooking.












Dual fuel ranges bring together a gas stovetop and electric oven, capitalizing on the benefits of both. Dual fuel ranges are designed for those who want the responsive, hands-on experience of an open flame on the stovetop, but also prefer the dry, even heat of an electric oven. Learn more about dual fuel ranges.












As you’re choosing a kitchen range, you will want to explore the different features available. Kitchen ranges come with a variety of cooking options, in a number of sizes with different burner configurations and oven capacities and in a number of finishes. Read more about kitchen range features below to help you narrow down the options as you make your choice.
Convection cooking is available in all range types. A convection oven has a fan that circulates hot air around the cavity so you can cook foods fast and don’t have to move dishes around as you cook. Learn more about convection vs. regular ovens.
Various sizing options help you find a range that's right for your family and your kitchen layout. A standard range is usually 30 inches wide and features 4 or 5 burners or elements on the stovetop. A 36-inch wide range is also widely available and is more likely to have 5 burners or elements. Compact models for small spaces and large, commercial-style ranges are also available. Learn more about range sizing.
Double oven ranges can give you more capacity and flexibility to cook all your family's favorites. A double oven has two separate cooking compartments that can be set to different temperatures, times and other settings like convection cooking. The lower oven is usually larger than the upper oven to ensure you still have space to cook large dishes. Learn more about the pros and cons of double ovens.
When selecting a kitchen range, you also want to consider the different finish options that are available. Ranges from Whirlpool brand come in timeless stainless steel, sleek black stainless, classic white and matte black. When choosing a finish, you’ll want to consider the overall aesthetic of your kitchen, your personal style and the benefits and drawbacks of each look.
Self-cleaning ranges are the perfect option if you have a busy household but you want to keep a sparkling clean kitchen. These ranges use high temperatures or steam to help remove leftover food and residue from previous baking or roasting sessions.
With a smart range, you can harness the power of technology to streamline your cooking process. Depending on the model, smart ranges allow you to set temperatures, select range settings and monitor cooking progress all from your phone, as well as set various cooking presets for different types of food.1
To ensure an ideal fit for a new kitchen range, it’s important to measure the cutout dimensions properly. Before installing a new range, be sure to remove the previous appliance to get an accurate measurement. Then, take note of the cutout height, width and depth. The new range should fit snugly within the available wall space in your kitchen.
Shop select models below or learn even more about ranges by browsing Whirlpool brand's full selection of models, features and options.

A kitchen range, also called a stove, brings together an oven and a stovetop/cooktop to keep up with all your cooking tasks from sautéing to baking. Ranges come in a variety of styles, sizes and fuel types to complement different cooking routines and kitchen aesthetics.
Over time, different terminology arose to refer to this classic cooking appliance, but a range and a stove are essentially the same thing when talking about modern kitchen appliances and these words can be used interchangeably. Learn more about the difference between a range vs stove vs oven and decide what’s right for your kitchen.
Within the kitchen range category, you have some choices regarding style, fuel type and features.
Freestanding ranges are designed to either stand alone or install between cabinets, while slide-in ranges are built to slide between cabinets or be integrated with kitchen islands for a more built-in look. The most noticeable difference between the two is the presence of a backguard on freestanding ranges where the oven controls are located. Slide-in ranges don’t have a backguard and instead place the controls on the front of the range. Learn more about these distinct styles in the slide-in vs freestanding range guide.
Kitchen ranges come in a variety of fuel types. Selecting a fuel type will depend on the cooking experience you prefer and your kitchen layout. Read more about the different fuel types below to help you decide which will work best for you.
Gas ranges have gas heat on the stovetop and inside the oven. They cook food with an open flame and require a dedicated natural gas or propane line. Gas heat is known for its responsiveness: the flame can be adjusted instantly, allowing you to quickly move between heat levels. An open flame can also be used to flame-grill, char and flambé right on the stovetop.












Electric ranges feature electric heat on the stovetop and inside the oven. On the stovetop, heat is typically generated through metal coils, often housed in an easy-to-clean, flat glass surface. Inside the oven, heating elements are generally known to provide dry, consistent heat excellent for roasting and broiling. Learn more about electric vs. gas ranges.












Induction ranges are technically electric ranges since they use electric power, but the stovetop heats differently. Induction stovetops generate electromagnetic energy that interacts directly with compatible cookware, turning pots and pans into their own heat source. These ranges are known for exceptional temperature control and ease of cleaning. Learn more about induction cooking.












Dual fuel ranges bring together a gas stovetop and electric oven, capitalizing on the benefits of both. Dual fuel ranges are designed for those who want the responsive, hands-on experience of an open flame on the stovetop, but also prefer the dry, even heat of an electric oven. Learn more about dual fuel ranges.












As you’re choosing a kitchen range, you will want to explore the different features available. Kitchen ranges come with a variety of cooking options, in a number of sizes with different burner configurations and oven capacities and in a number of finishes. Read more about kitchen range features below to help you narrow down the options as you make your choice.
Convection cooking is available in all range types. A convection oven has a fan that circulates hot air around the cavity so you can cook foods fast and don’t have to move dishes around as you cook. Learn more about convection vs. regular ovens.
Various sizing options help you find a range that's right for your family and your kitchen layout. A standard range is usually 30 inches wide and features 4 or 5 burners or elements on the stovetop. A 36-inch wide range is also widely available and is more likely to have 5 burners or elements. Compact models for small spaces and large, commercial-style ranges are also available. Learn more about range sizing.
Double oven ranges can give you more capacity and flexibility to cook all your family's favorites. A double oven has two separate cooking compartments that can be set to different temperatures, times and other settings like convection cooking. The lower oven is usually larger than the upper oven to ensure you still have space to cook large dishes. Learn more about the pros and cons of double ovens.
When selecting a kitchen range, you also want to consider the different finish options that are available. Ranges from Whirlpool brand come in timeless stainless steel, sleek black stainless, classic white and matte black. When choosing a finish, you’ll want to consider the overall aesthetic of your kitchen, your personal style and the benefits and drawbacks of each look.
Self-cleaning ranges are the perfect option if you have a busy household but you want to keep a sparkling clean kitchen. These ranges use high temperatures or steam to help remove leftover food and residue from previous baking or roasting sessions.
With a smart range, you can harness the power of technology to streamline your cooking process. Depending on the model, smart ranges allow you to set temperatures, select range settings and monitor cooking progress all from your phone, as well as set various cooking presets for different types of food.1
To ensure an ideal fit for a new kitchen range, it’s important to measure the cutout dimensions properly. Before installing a new range, be sure to remove the previous appliance to get an accurate measurement. Then, take note of the cutout height, width and depth. The new range should fit snugly within the available wall space in your kitchen.
Shop select models below or learn even more about ranges by browsing Whirlpool brand's full selection of models, features and options.

A kitchen range combines a cooktop, often called a stovetop, and an oven into a single appliance that covers all your culinary bases. Ranges let you sear, sauté or boil on top and bake, broil or roast inside. They come in gas, electric, dual fuel, freestanding and slide-in models in multiple sizes. Stove parts differ depending on whether it is a gas or electric stove.
If you’re deciding on the best cooking appliances for your kitchen, the first step is simple: choose between a kitchen range or a wall oven plus a separate cooktop. Read on to learn more about different types of kitchen ranges and how they can help enhance the way you create in the kitchen.
The term “stove” has had different meanings over time and usually refers to the entire appliance, or “range.” However, some people also associate it with only the top of the appliance, or “cooktop.” “Range” is the term used within the kitchen appliance industry to describe the entire appliance—oven plus stovetop—and should help you find what you need when shopping. Learn the difference between a range vs. stove vs. oven to choose the best appliance for your needs.
For a better idea of the elements that make up a range, read about types of ovens or explore the full selection of KitchenAid® ranges, as well as wall ovens and cooktops.
A range combines a stovetop (or cooktop) and oven in one appliance, while a cooktop is a flat surface that integrates into countertops and does not include an oven. With a cooktop, you can simmer, sauté, boil and do anything else you would do on top of your range, but you’ll need an oven for baking, roasting and broiling.
Whichever word you use, the right kitchen range can help bring any recipe to life. Explore all the different types of kitchen ranges with this quick breakdown or review these top range picks.
Induction ranges do not use flames or direct heat and instead use electromagnetism to generate heat within the compatible cookware itself. This produces a rapid rise and fall in temperature on an induction cooktop, so food and water come to temperature quickly and the cooktop cools down rapidly when the pan is removed from the surface. When shopping for an induction range, keep in mind that you will need to use specific cookware with magnetic bottoms.

30-INCH 4-ELEMENT IINDUCTION SLIDE-IN CONVECTION RANGE WITH AIR FRY
 
Model: KSIS730PSS
 
This induction range generates heat directly within cookware, and the oven features Even-Heat™ True Convection plus air fry mode, with an included dishwasher-safe air fry basket that aids in crisping and browning.
Gas ranges use an open flame on the cooktop as well as inside the oven to heat food. Gas heat is known to be highly responsive. Many home cooks prefer gas cooktops because the open flame allows for a hands-on experience, letting you move quickly between heat levels and cooking techniques. Most models, like the full line of KitchenAid® gas ranges, feature removable cast-iron grates with an easily wipeable surface underneath.

Electric ranges use heating elements on the cooktop and inside the oven to cook food. Electric heat inside the oven is produced by consistent element cycling, helping to promote even cooking for dishes like big batches of cookies or roast chicken. Many cooktops on electric ranges are smooth and flat, making them simple to clean. Some electric kitchen ranges feature elements with two or three rings that you can adjust for different cookware widths, like the entire selection of KitchenAid® electric ranges.

Dual fuel ranges combine a gas stovetop and electric oven, letting you take advantage of both. You may like a dual fuel range if you prefer the hands-on experience and responsive control of a gas cooktop, but also want the even, dry heat of an electric oven. Even heat in the oven helps deliver consistently cooked results while drier heat helps promote nice browning and crisping. Dual fuel ranges come in a variety of configurations and sizes.
For instance, KitchenAid® dual fuel ranges are available in both slide-in and freestanding models, some with up to six burners.

Keep in mind that both freestanding and slide-in ranges are available in gas, electric and dual fuel options, so prioritize your fuel type before deciding on a style. You can also compare freestanding vs. slide-in ranges to see which one is right for your kitchen.
 
Freestanding ranges feature finished sides, which allows them to be installed standing alone, between cabinets, or at the edge of the counter with one side exposed. Many models also have a backguard where the oven controls are located, which helps protect the wall behind the range from food and grease splatters. Find the flexibility you need with a lineup of gas, electric and dual fuel freestanding ranges from KitchenAid brand.

Slide-in ranges slide smoothly between cabinets for a seamless, built-in look. The controls are located up front, making them easy to reach. Plus, since they don’t have a backguard, they are ideal for kitchen island installations or in front of a wall with a decorative backsplash you want to show off. Select slide-in styles also often come with other premium features like KitchenAid® slide-in ranges with Even-Heat™ True Convection.

30-INCH 4-ELEMENT ELECTRIC DOWNDRAFT SLIDE-IN RANGE
 
Model: KSEG950ESS
 
This all-in-one electric range includes Downdraft, which integrates the ventilation system so a separate hood is not needed. Even-Heat™ True Convection circulates hot air throughout the entire oven, providing optimal temperatures combined with airflow for crisp, flaky baked goods, juicy, well-browned roasts and caramelized vegetables.
Commercial-style ranges are restaurant-inspired ranges. They combine high-end design and premium features to deliver a professional-style cooking experience at home. They’re available in wider widths than standard ranges and typically feature gas cooktops with high-BTU burner options and grill or griddle inserts. Commercial styling includes large front-control knobs, heavy-duty grates and expanded finish options.

Downdraft ranges eliminate the need for an overhead vent by capturing smoke, steam, grease particles and odors directly at the cooking surface. These can be a great option for open floor plans, kitchen island cooktops and kitchens that lack a range hood capacity. You can also use a retractable downdraft range hood that retracts into cabinets when not in use. KitchenAid brand offers both electric and gas downdraft cooktops to fit your kitchen preference.

Your range is both the workhorse and the centerpiece of the kitchen. If you’re shopping for a new one, the type you buy—gas, electric, or induction—is largely dictated by your home’s setup. Gas ranges require you to have either natural gas or propane service, while an electric or induction range will work as long as you have a 240-volt electric line in your kitchen. (If you don’t, you’ll need to pay an electrician to install one.)
If you want to convert from a gas range to either an electric smoothtop or an induction model, know that the Inflation Reduction Act provides rebates of up to $500 toward the cost of conversion and up to $840 for the new range. In some cases, even if you already have an electric range, you may qualify for the appliance credit if you update to a newer model.
Whichever style you need or prefer, you’ll find plenty of options to consider. In this guide, we’ll cover the details you’ll need to know when buying a range, as well as the lowdown on major brands you’re likely to encounter while shopping. Once you decide which features matter most to you, take a look at our comprehensive range ratings, which allow you to sort through over 200 models by type, price, and more.
Most ranges are electric or gas. Induction ranges are a type of electric range. Pro-style ranges are either gas or dual-fuel, which means they pair a gas cooktop with an electric oven. But you might also find a few dual-fuel ranges that are not pro-style models. Here’s what you need to know about the main categories when buying a range. 
Ranges with radiant electric smoothtops, which have electric heating elements hidden beneath a layer of flat glass, are a popular pick. All the models in our tests have at least one high-power burner. Most have expandable dual or triple elements that let you switch from a large high-power element to a small, lower-power element within it. Some ranges have a warming element in the center to keep side dishes warm.
A downside to radiant electric models is that they hold a lot of residual heat, so after reducing the temperature, burners will take a few minutes to settle at the lower setting. 
Depending on where you live and how much money you earn, your new electric range might qualify for rebates, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Induction ranges run on the same electric line as a regular electric range but use magnetic coils below the ceramic glass surface to send electromagnetic pulses that transfer energy directly to your cookware. Food on induction ranges boils faster and simmers more steadily, and any adjustment you make to a burner happens immediately because the elements themselves don’t get hot. If you’re transitioning from other types of cooking surfaces, consult our complete guide to induction cooking.
You’ll need magnetic cookware for an induction cooktop—but that’s not as difficult as it sounds. If a magnet strongly sticks to the bottom of a pot, the cookware will work with an induction range. You might already have some stainless steel or cast-iron cookware that’s induction-capable. Read our guide on determining whether cookware is induction-friendly, as well as our take on the best pots and pans for induction surfaces.
If you’re in the market for an induction range, read our summary of their pros and cons. Induction cooktops have typically been more expensive than conventional electric cooktops, but prices have come down recently. What’s more, the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives for the purchase of electric ranges, including induction, could help drive down the cost further.
Because of the flame it emits with each burner, a gas range provides a level of sensory feedback that electric models just can’t match. Most gas ranges have four or five burners of different sizes, typically with at least one high-power burner and one simmer burner.
Response time with gas ranges is particularly quick, especially when compared with a radiant smoothtop. When you turn the knob from high to medium on a gas cooktop, the pot—and the food in it—experiences that change almost immediately. And with most gas burners, you can strike a match to light them when your power is out. But gas burners—even high-power ones—tend to be slower to bring water to a boil than electric smoothtops and induction cooktops. 
Consumer Reports has undertaken testing to measure levels of potentially dangerous gases produced by gas ranges. In our evaluations, we’ve found that in some cases, these ranges can emit worrisome levels of nitrogen oxides, even with only a single burner in use. So when cooking with a gas range, make sure to create as much ventilation as possible by activating your range hood and opening windows and doors.
Pro-style ranges in our ratings are either gas or dual-fuel, meaning they partner gas burners with an electric oven. They tend to be built with heavy-gauge stainless steel, well-insulated ovens, and continuous cast-iron cooking grates, but these luxurious features often come at a higher price. 
Many regular ranges now offer features once unique to pro-style models, such as high-power burners, dedicated simmer burners, and convection, for a fraction of the price. In fact, the best gas and electric ranges in our ratings outperform the best pro-style models.
Some regular ranges may even offer more features than pro-style ones, according to CR’s range-testing engineer Tara Casaregola. “Even basic conveniences that you’d take for granted on a regular range, like a digital oven display or preheat light, are often missing on pro-style ranges," she says.
That being said, the best pro-style models are works of art. If that leaves you feeling empowered in the kitchen, a pro-style range might be a good option for you.
Once you’ve decided on a range type, consider the following factors to zero in on a model that fits your floor plan and cooking needs.
Freestanding vs. Slide-In RangesFreestanding ranges are the most widely sold and easiest to install. The controls are on a panel at the far end of the range. Slide-in ranges slip in between cabinets and appliances to give a custom, built-in look. Controls sit at the front of the range, so your backsplash can be showcased. The sides might not come finished, though, so a slide-in range might not work well as a replacement for a freestanding unit.
Range WidthMost gas, electric, and induction ranges are 30 inches wide. But a pro-style range can come in a larger size—even as wide as 48 inches—if you custom-configure it with extra burners, an additional oven, or an integrated grill, griddle, or wok burner. (In our labs, we test 30-inch and 36-inch pro-style ranges.)
Oven CapacityA roomy oven comes in handy when baking or entertaining. So assess the oven cavity in person if you can, or check the capacity scores in our range ratings. Note: We measure only the usable oven space, while some manufacturers advertise dimensions that include the space below the lowest rack position.
Single-Oven vs. Double-Oven RangesMany ranges now come in single- and double-oven configurations. Double-oven ranges often have a smaller oven on top and a larger one below. They’re great for baking or roasting two different foods at different temperatures. What’s more, you can activate just the smaller upper oven to save time on preheating for small items, like a pizza. But you’ll need to bend farther down to cook foods in the lower oven because the door for the larger oven is closer to the floor than that of a conventional oven. To explore other issues concerning double ovens (such as the absence of a storage drawer), see our guide on double-oven ranges.
Gas vs. Dual-Fuel RangesSome gas ranges are dual-fuel—they use gas for the cooktop and electric power for the oven. Electric ovens tend to be drier and more even in their heating. The downside is that you’ll need both a gas and a 240-volt power hookup because you’re using both systems at once.
Some models tout bells and whistles that can save time and boost convenience. But usually, the more features, the higher the price.
Almost every major range brand now has at least one model with an air-fry setting. It usually engages multiple fans to circulate hot air, much like a countertop air fryer. Some brands also include (or sell) wire mesh cooking baskets to maximize circulation, which comes in particularly handy if you’re whipping up homemade fries.

This feature lets you disable the electronic range controls. We recommend it if the control panel is at the front of the range. These ranges are more likely to be accidentally turned on, especially if you have young children in the house.
More typically found in mid- and higher-priced ranges, convection usually reduces cooking time, especially for large roasts, by using one or more fans to circulate hot air in the oven. Some ovens—typically electric models—have an extra convection heating element so that the convection fan is circulating the hottest air possible for more even results.
Some ranges, notably those from Samsung, have the ability to add or remove a divider between the upper and lower ovens. Samsung calls this Flex Duo, and it gives you the additional flexibility to move between a really large baking space (for an enormous holiday roast) and a smaller one (for a single sheet of cookies).

On gas cooktops, oval burners accommodate griddles and elongated pans. As for electric range tops, some have an elongated bridge element spanning two burners to fit a griddle or other odd-shaped cookware. Most electric radiant and induction smoothtops have an expandable burner that lets you choose the best size for your pot’s diameter. 
This light warns you when an element is still hot. That’s particularly useful on electric radiant smoothtops and induction ranges, which don’t emit a visible flame. (Although induction burners don’t get hot, touching an area where a hot pan was placed can still be dangerous.) Some ranges have a warning light for each burner; others have just one.
Ovens with variable broil provide adjustable low and high settings for food that needs slower or faster cooking. Most electric and gas ovens have this feature, except for some entry-level models.
Most WiFi-connected ranges work with an app on your smartphone to let you check the oven temperature, set a timer, or (if your range comes with a temperature probe) check the internal temperature of whatever you’re cooking. With electric ranges, you can even preheat your oven via your phone or turn off your oven or burner remotely if you accidentally leave it on.
