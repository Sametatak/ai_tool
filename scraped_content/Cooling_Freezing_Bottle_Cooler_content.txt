              A subreddit for campers concerned more about the act of camping and less concerned about hiking long distances or light gear. Primarily for tent/hammock camping. No RV camping here.
            

    Hi friends!
  

    I'm venturing out with the guys this weekend. I'm also going to be there a day earlier just to have a day to myself and relax before the shenanigans begin. 4 days in total for me. 3 for them.
  

    I've always used ice to keep my perishables cold. While I love the convenience of just buying 3-4 bags to fill the damn cooler, I'm also trying to cut costs to help make these trips less expensive. At the end of the day, it's just food, booze and gas I need to worry about. As long as I'm smart about meal planning, these trips will be inexpensive. Over nighters will obviously be cheaper, 3-4 days I understand will be more, but still want to cut the fat off somewhere.
  

    I was thinking the other night, what if I layer the bottom with frozen water bottles, place my meats next, layer home made ice packs (zip lock bag), and then Tupperware of prepped foods.
  

    Any suggestions and advice would be fantastic.
  

    Thanks!
  

    EDIT: Thank you all so much for the great advice! I'm leaving Thursday morning and won't be home til Monday morning. It's going to be a good one forsure! I've frozen lots of water bottles, zip lock bags, and I'm about to freeze some containers to make large ice cubes. I'll update you all when I get back. I'm excited to try this out! Cheers!

When freezing water bottles to prolong cool temps in my cooler, the bottles and/or caps sometimes split?  Are some brands of bottles more resistant to splitting than others?  Any tips for freezing water bottles without calamity?
???Don’t fill them all the way.
DasaniI buy the 16 oz Dasani bottles in 6 and/or 12 packs.  I’ve never had any of them freeze and expand to the point of splitting.

If you are filling and freezing your own, of course, leave a good inch of more of space near the top to allow for expansion.
I agreeIf you buy them prefilled or don’t over fill them, I don’t think you will have a problem. That is how we keep our main cooler cold when camping.  We freeze in our deep freezer a case of medium sized Aquafina and pack our food in that and frozen juice pouches instead of ice.  We’ve kept meat and such fresh (nearly frozen)for 9 days in a 5 day cooler. As the week goes on, we remove a few and defrost them for drinking, and pack for our paddling trips.
fill and freeze in layersFreezing in layers minimizes bulging - start by filling only ~ 1/3 full and freeze that much, then add another layer and put the bottle back in the freezer until frozen, and so on.  Sometimes I try to slant the bottle at first to spread out the first layer that expands.  This may be overkill, but I haven’t had any bottles split since doing the layering.  Only problem is remembering to start the process enough ahead of trip time!
PlatypusUse Platypus “bottles”. They can be frozen or boiled repeatedly.
Two choicesI use two liter soda bottles but leave plenty of space for expansion. But the best container I’ve found is the one they give you for the “human draino” you have to drink before going for your video physical (you over 50 types should know about this). It holds a gallon and fits well in coolers.
Try this:When you fill the bottle with water, squeeze the sides of the bottle (assuming it’s one of those handy square bottles) and then put on the cap with your third hand, or have your wife help you. Then when the ice expands, the bottle has enough “reserve” volume to handle the expansion. It works for me.

NalgeneI’ve not frozen a Nalgene before, but that’s what I would suggest.  I’ve boiled water and filled them up to keep warm while camping in below freezing temps.    I’m guessing it can have a similar result.  The steam has no place to escape, and I can see where it tried to push up on the cap as it made a bit of a ring where it was stressed.

Anyway, since it made it through multiple cycles of boiling, I assume freezing would work too … just maybe fill it 2/3 or 3/4.
Just last night.
Last night I poured about an inch out of a Gatoraid bottle and froze it.  This morning I took it out of the freezer and it was frozen solid to the top of the bottle.  I used it on a mountain bike ride and had slushy cold gatoraid for 4 hours.
Remember When?Milk used to be delivered to your home and in bottles. Maybe not, but if you forgot to bring it in on a cold day it would freeze and a frozen tube of milk would raise out of the top with the lid still on the tube…

Seems like a long time ago…
you made me look
I put 6 gatoraid bottles in the freezer a couple of days ago.  They are frozen solid.  The plastic bottles are fine.  I put water bottles in the freezer all the  time without reducing the volume of any of these prior to freezing. I've had no problems with expansion causing the plastic to split or break open.
Because!It was a LONG time ago…
Freezing water expands approx 10%by volume.  You figure it out.

:^)

glacial icefill 'em to the top.  you want the pressure.  it makes the ice freeze under pressure and actually will be colder.  (I was told by a scientist guy)

I have been doing it for years.  nalgene, pop bottles, whatever.  cool to see a 2L pop expanded, under pressure.

steve
unscrew partially before freezing.
Insulated biking bottlesSaturday night I mixed an electrolyte drink inside an insulated bicycling water bottle (Polar something-or-other), put it in the freezer overnight, and inspected it Sunday morning before taking it paddling.

The bottle was not expanded at all. Best of all, the contents stayed cold a long time. I transported it inside a cooler to our paddling location (50 minutes drive). Then inside my hot cockpit on a 97-degree day. It had barely begun to thaw by the time I first tried to drink from it about 30 minutes later. I had good, cold, iced beverage through 14 miles of paddling.
Mmmmm…slushy gatoradeSlushy gatorade…good stuff!
yupeasy enough of a solution…this is what I do, b/c even freezing a nalgene, the pressure will distort and weaken the cap.
stopped freezing bottlesFreezing water, in my opinion was…the greatest! I have frozen aquafina water bottles, no name water bottles, and also my nalgenes, and other polycarbonite bottles and some strange things have occured.  The water in various bottles tastes so awful we cannot drink it - various bottles at various times and used good filtered water in the reusables and the others had store bought water in them.  Ironically my sister showed me an article on pc bottles #7 and better choices because of Bisphenol-A (BPA) leaching into the water.  I am not one to get too alarmed over all the health scares but I believe this one is a real concern as I have tasted the water in these bottles (same type of bottle/same water but at different times one was awful and the other ok) frozen - a couple of times it was so bad that my daughter spit it out and with different ones so now unfortunately, i am replacing with the not so nice high density polyethylene bottles and using ice and a cold pack.  Just something to think about in case this has happened to your frozen water bottles.
None are deemed totally safe but i will make a “hopefully” better choice for my family.

Sometimes I only have 10-15 minutes and I have a water bottle out, but it's near room temperature. I need it to be near freezing, but I don't have time to do anything.
Usually I will just put it in the freezer until I have to leave, but that usually doesn't do much. Is there any way that I can get a regular plastic water bottle near freezing  temperature (or at least feel like it) in 10 to 15 minutes?
It would only have to be one water bottle at a time, and it would be great it the hack could work for Gatorade bottles too. The water must stay in the bottle (it's a hastle to get back in).

Always keep one bottle of water in the refrigerator (or freezer if you prefer a block of ice that will thaw throughout the day).  When it's time to go somewhere, swap your room temperature bottle for the cold one.
Before you argue that it doesn't answer the question, remember this is LifeHacks SE not Physics SE.  This takes less than 10 minutes, doesn't require you to remove the water from the bottle, and works with Gatorade.
Fill a bottle about half full and lay it on its side in the freezer with the neck tipped up just enough so that the water doesn't block it. Just before you leave take it out of the freezer and fill with water from the tap. While you're out the ice melts and cools the water. You could rotate bottles through the freezer so there's always one ready :)
We used to keep a container of very strong brine (water with a lot of salt dissolved in it) in the freezer for cooling beer bottles super quickly whenever The Thirst would strike. The brine could take a bottle from room temperature to freezing (we made a few beer slushies this way) in about 15 minutes. Problem was we didn't have a lid on the container and the salt water rusted out the door of the fridge.
Get some dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) or liquid nitrogen if you're cool. Dunk your water bottle into one of those for about 30 seconds for dry ice, 5 for liquid nitrogen. This will cool your bottle super-fast and even turn some of the water into ice. To increase the rate of heat transfer away from the bottle, cover pellets of dry ice with acetone. Acetone has a very low freezing point and can be purchased at most hardware stores.
How about the best of both worlds? Wrap the water bottle with salt-water soaked paper towel then put it in the freezer. Make sure to make as much contact between the water bottle and paper towel as possible.
The absolute fastest way is (as stated by mooseman) to submerge the water bottle in an iced salt water solution. If that is unavailable, the paper towel trick is next best.

Refrigerators and coolers are some of the most important equipment in any commercial kitchen, and keeping them in good condition is essential. A cooler that doesn't work correctly can cause drinks to be stored at the wrong temperature, ingredients to spoil, and pose a hazard in your workplace. Over time, even the most dependable brands, like Beverage-Air, will experience leaks, power issues, and the inability to maintain temperatures. We'll outline the major issues customers encounter with their Beverage-Air coolers and how to remedy them below.
Use the following links to navigate and learn how to troubleshoot common Beverage-Air cooler issues:
If your Beverage-Air cooler is not cooling, it may be an issue with your power supply or compressor. If you suspect either of these components may be causing your problems, there are two components you should check before calling a service technician.
The power supply provides the necessary power for your entire cooler to run, converting electric current from a power source, such as an electrical outlet. Without a fully functioning power supply, the unit will have significant performance issues. If you suspect an issue with your power supply, check the following factors:
The compressor is a vital component of a commercial cooler, responsible for circulating refrigerant throughout the unit. A faulty or failing compressor will significantly impact cooling efficiency. Even if you can remedy compressor issues in the short term, you should plan to have your unit checked by an authorized service technician eventually to avoid future problems.
A commercial cooler that takes too long to cool down or cannot maintain consistent temperatures poses a significant problem to your kitchen. Some issues with cooling efficiency are easy to remedy, while others require a more experienced hand to fix.
A Beverage-Air cooler that is leaking water is cause for concern, as it can be a symptom of significant underlying issues. Leaking coolers create a hazardous environment and should be fixed immediately to avoid potential damage to your unit and surrounding areas. Some leaks may be related to external factors, while others indicate an issue with the unit. If none of these issues seem to be occurring, call a support technician for assistance.
Below are some common issues that can cause your unit to make excessive noise. Even if you can remedy the noise on your own, an authorized service technician should still inspect the unit to prevent future issues.
When you need parts for your Beverage-Air cooler, we've got you covered! We carry a wide range of common accessories and replacement parts for popular Beverage-Air models.

Refrigerants Explained
Refrigerant is essential for cooling refrigerators and air conditioners but it generally isn't a factor most people think about when making a purchase. However, with refrigerant laws changing and certain refrigerant types becoming illegal , it is important to understand the differences between the types of refrigerant when it comes to replacing your refrigerator or freezer. Shop All Commercial Refrigerators What is Refrigerant? Refrigerant is a cooling agent that absorbs heat and leaves cool air behind when passed through a compressor and evaporator. It fluctuates between a liquid or gas state as it goes through the thermodynamic process. How Refrigerant Works Here is how refrigerant cools the inside of refrigerators and the air for AC unit
Refrigerated Merchandisers Buying Guide
Refrigerated merchandisers and freezer merchandisers share many similar components with other commercial refrigeration products.

Something went wrong. Wait a moment and try again.

Just did this with an amber ale that’s still in the fermenter.  I always keep some large plastic water bottles frozen in the freezer for use in coolers, whatever.  My beer’s been pretty cloudy mostly (only on my 5th batch now), so I wanted to get my cooling process faster.  I sanitized two of my frozen bottles and put them directly into the wort while it was cooling in an ice bath.  Worked like a charm.  Had it under 100 degrees in very little time.  This was a 1-gallon batch.
Anybody see a downside to this, as long as I’m making sure they’re sanitized?  Sure is a lot cheaper than buying a chiller.
If it works it works.
I usually have about 3 to 4 gallons in the boil kettle.  I set it in the kitchen sink and fill the sink with cold water.  Kettle lid is partially off.  I stir gently until the sink water is warm.  Drain the water and refill.  When the second refill water is tepid, drain and add ice from the frig freezer bin and refill with tap water.  Stir occasionally.  Wort will be under 70°F within 20 minutes.
I havebeen. Using 3 frozen 2lt bottles and it works fine just sanitize well haven’t had any contamination issues cheap and efficient that’s not to say i. Just ordered a chiller good work brew on
My preference is to avoid putting unnecessary things into the wort once the boil has been completed - so I hadn’t thought about this approach to cooling the wort before pitching the yeast.  But I was curious and had some time late this afternoon.
It appears that  restaurants (I don’t work in that industry) have devices called cooling paddles that are food grade plastic at high temps  (random example) to cool liquids quickly - although this post suggests that they may not work well for getting the wort to pitching temp.
For my one gallon batches, I’m happy with a 30 minute cool down which goes like this:
If I were looking for a way to shave some minutes off of the wort cooling step (or save a couple of gallons of water), Australian no chill brewing would be something that I’d take a look at.
My beer’s been pretty cloudy mostly (only on my 5th batch now), so I wanted to get my cooling process faster.
For my one gallon batches, I add a quarter teaspoon (not tablespoon, teaspoon) of Irish Moss to the boil about 15 minutes before flameout.  It clears the beer up very nicely.
me can not use a wort chiller her on the island   water from the faucet   comes out at a temp around  90 to 80 fh   so i do use a  big  cement bucket with four bags of ice  got the temp fast down  .but putting ice bottles into to wort  .this might cause  infection of the wort  or am i wrong?
Wash the bottles before you freeze them. Keep them in a clean bag in the freezer so as not to get any contaminants on them when putting stuff in and out of the freezer. On brew day rinse them in starsan an throw them in to chill. Make sure you fill the bottles with clean water just in case they leak. That’s how I would do it anyway.
I did that a long time ago before getting a chiller. That was without having the pot in an ice bath. I froze a bunch of plastic bottles of water then dunked them in no rinse sanitizer just before dunking them in the wort. It always worked but was kind of labor intensive and you really need a spare fridge or freezer because that many bottles takes up a lot of room. Don’t fill the bottles all the way up either. 
Great idea.
Isn’t it kind of cheating to use irish moss?  What would the Germans say?
Who cares what the Germans say, when here, do as here would do! Sneezles61

“Das war ein ausgezeichnetes Bier - gestochen scharfe, klare, erfrischende.  Wären Sie so freundlich, uns Gießen ein anderes?”

I still haven’t gotten over being banned for an article I had published in Zymurgy that had nothing to do with their little forum.
