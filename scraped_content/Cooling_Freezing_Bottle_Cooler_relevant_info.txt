- **Details**: I'm venturing out with the guys this weekend. I'm also going to be there a day earlier just to have a day to myself and relax before the shenanigans begin. 4 days in total for me. 3 for them. I've always used ice to keep my perishables cold. While I love the convenience of just buying 3-4 bags to fill the damn cooler, I'm also trying to cut costs to help make these trips less expensive. At the end of the day, it's just food, booze and gas I need to worry about. As long as I'm smart about meal planning, these trips will be inexpensive. Over nighters will obviously be cheaper, 3-4 days I understand will be more, but still want to cut the fat off somewhere. I was thinking the other night, what if I layer the bottom with frozen water bottles, place my meats next, layer home-made ice packs (zip lock bag), and then Tupperware of prepped foods. Any suggestions and advice would be fantastic. Thanks!
