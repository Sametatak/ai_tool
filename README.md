# LLM Semantic Search and Information Processing
This project involves the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) for semantic search and reasoning to gather, process, and tag information from various sources. The project is divided into four main parts:

# Part 1: Source Identification
The first step is to identify the top 20 sources (websites) for each category and subcategory based on the LLM's semantic search and reasoning capabilities. This involves:

-Using the LLM to determine the best sources for each type of information.
-Compiling a list of these sources for further processing.
# Part 2: Information Extraction
Once the sources are identified, the next step is to extract relevant information from these sources. This involves:

-Using web scraping techniques to read the content from the identified sources.
-Collecting the relevant information in text files.
-Experimenting with different web scraping methods and comparing the results.
# Part 3: Data Tagging
The collected information needs to be tagged for easier retrieval and analysis. This involves:

-Tagging the data with relevant category, subcategory, information type, product type, source type, and country information.
-Using the LLM (or another software) to automate the tagging process.
# Part 4: Information Display
-The final step is to create a user interface where the tagged information packages (feeds) can be filtered and viewed. This involves:

-Developing a UI that allows users to filter and view the tagged information.
-Ensuring the information is easily accessible and navigable.
